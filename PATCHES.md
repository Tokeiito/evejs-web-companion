# Patch manifest

Every branch carried on top of `vendor`, in the order it is merged into `main`. This file is the
authority: a patch not listed here is lost on the next rebuild, and a patch listed here is one
somebody has decided is still needed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the workflow.

**Vendor:** `origin/master` at `73e7cd1` (2026-10-01, PR #54 merged). `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.7`.

The `On main` column is a cache of `git branch --merged main`; if the two disagree, ancestry wins.

| # | Branch | What it carries | Files | Upstream | On main |
| - | ------ | --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | `local/tooling` | This workflow: `CLAUDE.md`, this manifest, and the Claude Code hooks registered in `.claude/settings.local.json` -- `guard-live-bot.sh` (refuses restarts that would kill running bots) and `rebuild-when-stale.sh`, each with its test | `CLAUDE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `.claude/hooks/` | never | yes |
| 2 | `local/deploy` | The hive release pipeline: a `release/*` tag on Gitea builds and pushes the image and moves `deploy/prod`, which Portainer polls; `compose.hive.yaml` joins the evej stack's network and volume as externals | `.gitea/workflows/release.yaml`, `compose.hive.yaml`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | never | yes |
| 3 | `feat/companion-industry-invention-setup` | Follow-up to the Industry Manager (#54), from a real invention job: running invention jobs count as attempts underway (and their datacores as spent); attempts are copies / chance to the nearest, not rounded up; a facility must host the work (manufacturing, reactions or invention) for a copy there to count; and Set up in Industry covers invention (a copy with runs left, Scientific Networking reach, the datacores for every run where the copy is; no decryptor, as the Industry panel sends none). Also decryptors in the Industry panel itself: choosing invention offers every decryptor, the preview lists it at one per run, and the install carries it; the server takes a decryptor only from the request materials and then compares that map exactly, so the BFF sends the exact map for that case (`src/industryInstall.js`: per-run invention materials x runs x the facility invention material modifiers read off GetFacilities, rounded as the server rounds, plus the decryptor). And the install preview names every material its recipe uses. | `web/src/bridge/industryJobs.ts`, `industryInvention.ts`, `web/src/ui/IndustryManager.svelte`, `web/src/app/industryInstallTarget.ts`, `web/src/ui/Industry.svelte`, `web/src/app/flow.ts`, `api.ts`, `src/industryInstall.js`, `src/server.js` (install route), tests | [#55](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/55) | yes |

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fifth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #54 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.7`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-manager/2026-10-01.7`.

- `feat/companion-industry-manager` -- [#54](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/54)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fourth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #53 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01`; the branch is
`archive/fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach/2026-10-01`.

- `fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach` -- [#53](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/53)

## Retired 2026-09-30 (third sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #49-#52 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-30.3`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-30.3` (`.3` because `archive/feat/companion-bot-categories/2026-09-30.2`
already named an earlier rebase that day).

- `fix/companion-builder-without-pilot` -- [#49](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/49)
- `feat/companion-bot-categories` -- [#50](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/50)

- `feat/companion-fight-back-drone-rotation` -- [#52](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/52)

## Retired 2026-09-29 (second sync): upstream merged all five

Upstream merged PRs #36-#40 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-29.2`; each branch is

## Retired at the start of this model (2026-09-29)

The old `tokeiito` branch is frozen as tag `custom/2026-09-29`. Against `origin/master` it
differed in 40 files; everything else it carried had already gone upstream as the stacked
PRs #11-#35, all merged. The rest was dropped rather than carried:

- **Chat blocks** (`send-chat`, the `players-in-system-above` condition, `web/src/bridge/social.ts`
  and their tests). Upstream retired companion chat on purpose (`e500758 feat(web): retire companion
  chat`); the 2026-09-28 sync had kept ours. Dropped to follow upstream: saved bots using either
  are now refused on load with upstream's retired-feature message.
- **Comment drift**: a dated incident note in `compose.yaml`, leftover hunt/`engagePrey` comments
  in `flow.ts` and `fleetCompanionLoop.ts`, and chat wording in `PanelHost.svelte`. Upstream's
  wording taken.
- The 25 local feature branches of the `up/*` era, every one of them absorbed upstream; they
  stay reachable from the tag.
