# Patch manifest

Every branch carried on top of `vendor`, in the order it is merged into `main`. This file is the
authority: a patch not listed here is lost on the next rebuild, and a patch listed here is one
somebody has decided is still needed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the workflow.

**Vendor:** `origin/master` at `b2cb4b5` (2026-10-06, PR #107 merged). `main` as it ran before the last sync is tag `custom/2026-10-06`.

The `On main` column is a cache of `git branch --merged main`; if the two disagree, ancestry wins.

| # | Branch | What it carries | Files | Upstream | On main |
| - | ------ | --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | `local/tooling` | This workflow: `CLAUDE.md`, this manifest, and the Claude Code hooks registered in `.claude/settings.local.json` -- `guard-live-bot.sh` (refuses restarts that would kill running bots) and `rebuild-when-stale.sh`, each with its test | `CLAUDE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `.claude/hooks/` | never | yes |
| 2 | `local/deploy` | The hive release pipeline: a `release/*` tag on Gitea builds and pushes the image and moves `deploy/prod`, which Portainer polls; `compose.hive.yaml` joins the evej stack's network and volume as externals | `.gitea/workflows/release.yaml`, `compose.hive.yaml`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | never | yes |
| 3 | `fix/companion-persist-bridge-sessions` | A BFF restart releases the pilots the previous process held. The bridge handles lived only in memory, so every restart left each selected pilot online at the gateway (`retail_client`) until its 30-minute idle TTL, and hosted Start refused them all ("A web session is flying this character"). The held map now mirrors handle/account/character to `data/bridge-sessions.json`; `startServer` releases those before resuming bots. Seen live 2026-10-04: five pilots refused after the 08:22 rebuild. Upstream #91 reworked held-session release on selection but still keeps the map only in memory, so the restart leak stands. | `src/bridgeSessionJournal.js` (new), `src/server.js`, `src/bridgeSessionJournal.test.js`, `test/bridgeSessionRestart.test.js` | not yet (verify live first) | yes |
| 4 | `fix/companion-scan-full-state-route` | The scanner reads one server call instead of eight. The scanner panel and the bot's anomaly/ore-site observation need only `scanMgr.GetFullState` but read it through `/api/bridge/bound-small-services`, which always fires all eight small-service reads, `warRegistry.GetWars`/`GetNegotiations` among them. With nine pilots online those two alone took ~55% of the server's one core (measured 2026-10-06: 69 calls each in 30 s at ~120 ms, every call blocking the server's event loop). New `GET /api/bridge/scan-full-state` makes the one call in the same envelope; `loadScanFullState` and `loadScanner` use it. `bound-small-services` is unchanged. Verified live 2026-10-06 with five bots flying: in 60 s the BFF sent 80 `scanMgr.GetFullState` (all via the new route), no `warRegistry` call, and bots still warped to scanned sites. | `src/server.js`, `web/src/app/api.ts`, `web/src/app/flow.ts`, tests | [#108](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/108) (open; verified live 2026-10-06) | yes |
| 5 | `fix/companion-ice-site-already-inside` | A refused mining site the scanner still lists is not mined out. The server words a torn-down site and a ship it still files under that site's pocket the same ("You cannot warp there right now."), and the warp-to-site block read the last refusal as the system running dry. Seen live 2026-10-06: a server restart caught a pilot mid-warp, restored her off the ice field's grid with the pocket tracker set, and she stopped on "Every ice site in this system is mined out" while four pilots mined in it. Now the scanner is re-read (~20 s); a site still listed sends the ship to dock and back once (a dock clears the tracker, verified live the same day), and a second refusal stops with what the server said. | `web/src/nav/scriptMacros.ts`, tests | not yet (verify the dock trip live first) | yes |

## Retired 2026-10-06 (thirteenth sync): upstream merged rows 4-9

Upstream merged PRs #101-#107 as true merges, so each branch is an ancestor of `vendor` and is retired outright.

## Retired 2026-10-05 (twelfth sync): the freeze lifts; upstream merged the refusal fix and the ice sites

From 2026-10-04 `main` was frozen on `custom/2026-10-03b` (upstream `2ef352f`), because upstream
`de60080` (#81) sent every hosted bot Start through `POST /_evejs-web/v1/factory/session`, a gateway
route our server does not serve, and every Start failed with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`. Upstream #91
(`2be818c`, "restore stock hosted start selection") moved hosted selection onto the stock
`/session/select`, which the server does serve, and `e43cad5` removed the `/factory/session` call
altogether. This sync rebuilt `main` on `vendor` again; `local/tooling-frozen`, the side branch the
manifest reached the frozen `main` through, is retired with it. The frozen `main` is tag
`custom/2026-10-05b`.

- `fix/companion-refused-warp-and-lock` -- [#90](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/90), taken by upstream through #92/#93
- `feat/companion-scanner-ice-sites` -- [#95](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/95)

## Retired 2026-10-04 (eleventh sync): upstream merged the facility bonuses

Upstream merged PR #79 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. The same sync brought in #74-#78 and #80-#85 from another contributor
(provisioning, Startup/Main execution, the Defender role) and an overview PR that upstream merged
and then reverted (#87-#89); 143 files in all, `scriptRunner.ts`, `scriptDecide.ts` and
`scriptMacros.ts` among them, none of it touching how a refused action is committed. `main` as it
ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-04`; the branches are `archive/<branch>/2026-10-04`.

- `feat/companion-industry-facility-bonuses` -- [#79](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/79)

## Retired 2026-10-03 (tenth sync): upstream merged the customs export

Upstream merged PR #70 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. Upstream added two commits of its own to the PR branch before merging
(`1279c05` export ownership and partial progress, `721edc4` drone readiness across the docked
handback); they arrive through `vendor`. Stale local branches `feat/companion-pi-haul-button`
(retired in the ninth sync) and `patch/happy-albattani-658b4f` (already in `vendor`) were deleted
with it, and every fork branch whose PR is merged. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag
`custom/2026-10-03b`; the branches are `archive/<branch>/2026-10-03b`.

- `feat/companion-pi-customs-export` -- [#70](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/70)

## Retired 2026-10-03 (ninth sync): upstream took the Haul button its own way

Upstream did not merge `feat/companion-pi-haul-button` as commits. It re-expressed the work on
its own `codex/pr-68-integration` branch and merged that as
[#69](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/69), so the branch is NOT an ancestor
of `vendor` and `git branch --merged vendor` does not list it. The Haul button, the per-colony
checkboxes, the "Deliver to" / "Unload into" pickers, the division-name learning, the
`planetList` arg and the `board-planetary-hauler` block are all in `vendor` now, so the branch is
retired.

⚠ ONE THING DID NOT COME BACK. Upstream dropped the in-tab path (our `a553827`): their
`restartExtractors` and `haul` both go straight to the server bot host, which refuses a pilot a
web session holds. So the one pilot the player has open in the tab is again the one pilot the PI
window cannot use. Nothing carries that behaviour today; it is a deliberate gap, recorded here
rather than silently re-added.

- `feat/companion-pi-haul-button` -- [#68](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/68),
  taken via [#69](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/69)

## Retired 2026-10-02 (eighth sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #64-#67 as true merges, so all four branches became ancestors of `vendor` and were
retired outright. The Haul button work, which had been one more commit on `feat/companion-pi-customs-haul`,
had already moved to its own branch (row 4) and was rebased onto the new `vendor`. `main` as it ran before
this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-02b`; the branches are `archive/<branch>/2026-10-02b`.

- `feat/companion-rack-reload` -- [#64](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/64)
- `fix/companion-probe-launcher-activation` -- [#65](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/65)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (seventh sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #62 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.12`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-decryptor-handoff/2026-10-01.12`.

- `feat/companion-industry-decryptor-handoff` -- [#62](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/62)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (sixth sync): upstream merged one of ours

Upstream merged PR #55 as a true merge, at the branch's third commit. The branch had one more
commit on it by then (the decryptor handoff), which moved to its own branch off the new `vendor`
(row 3); the rest was an ancestor of `vendor` and was retired outright. Upstream also merged
#56-#61 from another contributor (mining support), touching none of our files. `main` as it ran
before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.11`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-invention-setup/2026-10-01.11`.

- `feat/companion-industry-invention-setup` -- [#55](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/55)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fifth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #54 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.7`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-manager/2026-10-01.7`.

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fourth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #53 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01`; the branch is

## Retired 2026-09-30 (third sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #49-#52 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-30.3`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-30.3` (`.3` because `archive/feat/companion-bot-categories/2026-09-30.2`
already named an earlier rebase that day).

- `fix/companion-builder-without-pilot` -- [#49](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/49)

## Retired at the start of this model (2026-09-29)

The old `tokeiito` branch is frozen as tag `custom/2026-09-29`. Against `origin/master` it
differed in 40 files; everything else it carried had already gone upstream as the stacked
PRs #11-#35, all merged. The rest was dropped rather than carried:

- **Chat blocks** (`send-chat`, the `players-in-system-above` condition, `web/src/bridge/social.ts`
  and their tests). Upstream retired companion chat on purpose (`e500758 feat(web): retire companion
  chat`); the 2026-09-28 sync had kept ours. Dropped to follow upstream: saved bots using either
  are now refused on load with upstream's retired-feature message.
- **Comment drift**: a dated incident note in `compose.yaml`, leftover hunt/`engagePrey` comments
  in `flow.ts` and `fleetCompanionLoop.ts`, and chat wording in `PanelHost.svelte`. Upstream's
  wording taken.
- The 25 local feature branches of the `up/*` era, every one of them absorbed upstream; they
  stay reachable from the tag.
