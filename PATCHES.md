# Patch manifest

Every branch carried on top of `vendor`, in the order it is merged into `main`. This file is the
authority: a patch not listed here is lost on the next rebuild, and a patch listed here is one
somebody has decided is still needed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the workflow.

**Vendor:** `origin/master` at `03edcd5` (2026-10-01, PR #53 merged). `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01`.

The `On main` column is a cache of `git branch --merged main`; if the two disagree, ancestry wins.

| # | Branch | What it carries | Files | Upstream | On main |
| - | ------ | --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | `local/tooling` | This workflow: `CLAUDE.md`, this manifest, and the Claude Code hooks registered in `.claude/settings.local.json` -- `guard-live-bot.sh` (refuses restarts that would kill running bots) and `rebuild-when-stale.sh`, each with its test | `CLAUDE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `.claude/hooks/` | never | yes |
| 2 | `local/deploy` | The hive release pipeline: a `release/*` tag on Gitea builds and pushes the image and moves `deploy/prod`, which Portainer polls; `compose.hive.yaml` joins the evej stack's network and volume as externals | `.gitea/workflows/release.yaml`, `compose.hive.yaml`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | never | yes |
| 3 | `feat/companion-industry-manager` | The Industry Manager (goal R109, `docs/goal-prompts/r109-industry-manager.md`): a global window beside Planetary Industry. Pick a blueprint a signed-in pilot owns or search any published one, and see its whole build tree worked once per type with the server's own per-job material rounding, batch leftovers and reactions (the blueprint table's own product index misses all 119 reactions, so the index is built from activity products). Plans are saved like PI plans (migration 2, `industry_plans`, intent only). Stock comes from every hangar pilot's snapshot (`POST /api/roster/stock`, no select) and their corps' hangars. Missing items come with every place they sit and a Copy multibuy, and running jobs count toward the plan. Start next opens the holding pilot's Industry panel with the job filled in, behind that panel's own confirm. Invention odds use the server's formula and a decryptor chosen per plan. Touches PI only to export two helpers and give the PI stock and corp reads an optional type filter that defaults to planetary. Not yet exercised live at the time of writing. | `src/industryRecipes.js`, `industryPlanStore.js`, `companionDb.js`, `server.js`, `staticData.js`, `web/src/bridge/industry*.ts`, `web/src/app/industry*.ts`, `web/src/ui/IndustryManager.svelte`, `Industry.svelte` (prefill), tab registration, tests | not yet | yes |

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fourth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #53 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01`; the branch is
`archive/fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach/2026-10-01`.

- `fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach` -- [#53](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/53)

## Retired 2026-09-30 (third sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #49-#52 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-30.3`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-30.3` (`.3` because `archive/feat/companion-bot-categories/2026-09-30.2`
already named an earlier rebase that day).

- `fix/companion-builder-without-pilot` -- [#49](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/49)
- `feat/companion-bot-categories` -- [#50](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/50)

- `feat/companion-fight-back-drone-rotation` -- [#52](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/52)

## Retired 2026-09-29 (second sync): upstream merged all five

Upstream merged PRs #36-#40 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-29.2`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-29.2`.

## Retired at the start of this model (2026-09-29)

The old `tokeiito` branch is frozen as tag `custom/2026-09-29`. Against `origin/master` it
differed in 40 files; everything else it carried had already gone upstream as the stacked
PRs #11-#35, all merged. The rest was dropped rather than carried:

- **Chat blocks** (`send-chat`, the `players-in-system-above` condition, `web/src/bridge/social.ts`
  and their tests). Upstream retired companion chat on purpose (`e500758 feat(web): retire companion
  chat`); the 2026-09-28 sync had kept ours. Dropped to follow upstream: saved bots using either
  are now refused on load with upstream's retired-feature message.
- **Comment drift**: a dated incident note in `compose.yaml`, leftover hunt/`engagePrey` comments
  in `flow.ts` and `fleetCompanionLoop.ts`, and chat wording in `PanelHost.svelte`. Upstream's
  wording taken.
- The 25 local feature branches of the `up/*` era, every one of them absorbed upstream; they
  stay reachable from the tag.
