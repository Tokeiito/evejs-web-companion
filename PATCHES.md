# Patch manifest

Every branch carried on top of `vendor`, in the order it is merged into `main`. This file is the
authority: a patch not listed here is lost on the next rebuild, and a patch listed here is one
somebody has decided is still needed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the workflow.

**Vendor:** `origin/master` at `1c9338a` (2026-09-29, PR #40 merged).

The `On main` column is a cache of `git branch --merged main`; if the two disagree, ancestry wins.

| # | Branch | What it carries | Files | Upstream | On main |
| - | ------ | --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | `local/tooling` | This workflow: `CLAUDE.md`, this manifest, and the Claude Code hooks registered in `.claude/settings.local.json` -- `guard-live-bot.sh` (refuses restarts that would kill running bots) and `rebuild-when-stale.sh`, each with its test | `CLAUDE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `.claude/hooks/` | never | yes |
| 2 | `local/deploy` | The hive release pipeline: a `release/*` tag on Gitea builds and pushes the image and moves `deploy/prod`, which Portainer polls; `compose.hive.yaml` joins the evej stack's network and volume as externals | `.gitea/workflows/release.yaml`, `compose.hive.yaml`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | never | yes |
| 3 | `fix/companion-builder-without-pilot` | The Bot Manager's New bot and Edit work with no pilot in the client: the Bot Builder takes a narrow `BuilderFlow`, and on the hangar it floats on the global layer riding an account sign-in | `web/src/bots/builderFlow.ts`, `web/src/ui/HangarBotBuilder.svelte`, `BotBuilder`/`BotManager`/`App`/`GlobalPanel.svelte`, `globalWindow.ts`, picker prop types | not yet opened | yes |

## Retired 2026-09-29 (second sync): upstream merged all five

Upstream merged PRs #36-#40 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-29.2`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-29.2`.

- `fix/companion-fleet-not-in-fleet` -- [#36](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/36)
- `fix/companion-pi-narrow-container` -- [#37](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/37)
- `feat/companion-bot-manager-rail` -- [#38](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/38)
- `fix/companion-drone-stack-quantity` -- [#39](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/39)
- `fix/companion-salvage-lock-wreck` -- [#40](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/40)

## Retired at the start of this model (2026-09-29)

The old `tokeiito` branch is frozen as tag `custom/2026-09-29`. Against `origin/master` it
differed in 40 files; everything else it carried had already gone upstream as the stacked
PRs #11-#35, all merged. The rest was dropped rather than carried:

- **Chat blocks** (`send-chat`, the `players-in-system-above` condition, `web/src/bridge/social.ts`
  and their tests). Upstream retired companion chat on purpose (`e500758 feat(web): retire companion
  chat`); the 2026-09-28 sync had kept ours. Dropped to follow upstream: saved bots using either
  are now refused on load with upstream's retired-feature message.
- **Comment drift**: a dated incident note in `compose.yaml`, leftover hunt/`engagePrey` comments
  in `flow.ts` and `fleetCompanionLoop.ts`, and chat wording in `PanelHost.svelte`. Upstream's
  wording taken.
- The 25 local feature branches of the `up/*` era, every one of them absorbed upstream; they
  stay reachable from the tag.
