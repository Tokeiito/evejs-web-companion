# Patch manifest

Every branch carried on top of `vendor`, in the order it is merged into `main`. This file is the
authority: a patch not listed here is lost on the next rebuild, and a patch listed here is one
somebody has decided is still needed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the workflow.

**Vendor:** `origin/master` at `fecf96d` (2026-10-02, PRs #64-#67 merged). `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-02b`.

The `On main` column is a cache of `git branch --merged main`; if the two disagree, ancestry wins.

| # | Branch | What it carries | Files | Upstream | On main |
| - | ------ | --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 | `local/tooling` | This workflow: `CLAUDE.md`, this manifest, and the Claude Code hooks registered in `.claude/settings.local.json` -- `guard-live-bot.sh` (refuses restarts that would kill running bots) and `rebuild-when-stale.sh`, each with its test | `CLAUDE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `.claude/hooks/` | never | yes |
| 2 | `local/deploy` | The hive release pipeline: a `release/*` tag on Gitea builds and pushes the image and moves `deploy/prod`, which Portainer polls; `compose.hive.yaml` joins the evej stack's network and volume as externals | `.gitea/workflows/release.yaml`, `compose.hive.yaml`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | never | yes |
| 3 | `feat/companion-industry-facility-bonuses` | The Industry Manager counts facility bonuses and shows job times: each job is worked where it would run (its copy, else the plan Build at / React at facility, saved as `choices.facilities`), with that facility material and time modifiers from GetFacilities (category, group, type matching), and job time the server way (TE, facility, the pilot industry time attribute from skills, required-skill bonuses from dogma 1982). Checked against the server own functions on 64 cases. Not exercised in game, by choice. | `web/src/bridge/industryFacility.ts`, `industry.ts`, `industryRecipes.ts`, `industryChain.ts`, `web/src/ui/IndustryManager.svelte`, `web/src/app/industryPlans.ts`, `api.ts`, `store/types.ts`, `src/industryRecipes.js`, `industryPlanStore.js`, `server.js` (closure route), tests | not yet | yes |
| 4 | `feat/companion-pi-haul-button` | The Planetary Industry window hauls the ticked colonies: a checkbox per colony and, per pilot, a Haul button that writes the board's saved bot "Planetary: haul" (launch the ticked colonies, board a parked hull with a planetary hold, collect per system, deliver, unload, back into the earlier ship) and starts it through the bot host. "Deliver to" station and "Unload into" division remembered per pilot; division names learned per corporation from an online pilot or a running bot (new BFF read `/api/bots/corp-division-names`). Adds the `planetList` arg (launch-commodities `planets`) and the `board-planetary-hauler` block. | `web/src/ui/PiManager.svelte`, `web/src/app/piDispatch.ts`, `piHaulPrefs.ts`, `api.ts`, `flow.ts`, `web/src/bridge/piBoard.ts`, `web/src/nav/scriptMacros.ts`, `scriptConditions.ts`, `web/src/bots/*` (arg kind, block), `web/src/ui/BotInspector.svelte`, `src/server.js`, tests | [#68](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/68) (open) | yes |

## Retired 2026-10-02 (eighth sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #64-#67 as true merges, so all four branches became ancestors of `vendor` and were
retired outright. The Haul button work, which had been one more commit on `feat/companion-pi-customs-haul`,
had already moved to its own branch (row 4) and was rebased onto the new `vendor`. `main` as it ran before
this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-02b`; the branches are `archive/<branch>/2026-10-02b`.

- `feat/companion-rack-reload` -- [#64](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/64)
- `fix/companion-probe-launcher-activation` -- [#65](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/65)
- `fix/companion-stale-upstream-tests` -- [#66](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/66)
- `feat/companion-pi-customs-haul` -- [#67](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/67)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (seventh sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #62 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.12`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-decryptor-handoff/2026-10-01.12`.

- `feat/companion-industry-decryptor-handoff` -- [#62](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/62)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (sixth sync): upstream merged one of ours

Upstream merged PR #55 as a true merge, at the branch's third commit. The branch had one more
commit on it by then (the decryptor handoff), which moved to its own branch off the new `vendor`
(row 3); the rest was an ancestor of `vendor` and was retired outright. Upstream also merged
#56-#61 from another contributor (mining support), touching none of our files. `main` as it ran
before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.11`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-invention-setup/2026-10-01.11`.

- `feat/companion-industry-invention-setup` -- [#55](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/55)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fifth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #54 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01.7`; the branch is
`archive/feat/companion-industry-manager/2026-10-01.7`.

- `feat/companion-industry-manager` -- [#54](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/54)

## Retired 2026-10-01 (fourth sync): upstream merged one

Upstream merged PR #53 as a true merge, so the branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-10-01`; the branch is
`archive/fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach/2026-10-01`.

- `fix/companion-fight-back-out-of-reach` -- [#53](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/53)

## Retired 2026-09-30 (third sync): upstream merged four

Upstream merged PRs #49-#52 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-30.3`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-30.3` (`.3` because `archive/feat/companion-bot-categories/2026-09-30.2`
already named an earlier rebase that day).

- `fix/companion-builder-without-pilot` -- [#49](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/49)
- `feat/companion-bot-categories` -- [#50](https://github.com/rrfarmer/evejs-web-companion/pull/50)

## Retired 2026-09-29 (second sync): upstream merged all five

Upstream merged PRs #36-#40 as true merges, so each branch became an ancestor of `vendor` and was
retired outright. `main` as it ran before this sync is tag `custom/2026-09-29.2`; each branch is
`archive/<branch>/2026-09-29.2`.

## Retired at the start of this model (2026-09-29)

The old `tokeiito` branch is frozen as tag `custom/2026-09-29`. Against `origin/master` it
differed in 40 files; everything else it carried had already gone upstream as the stacked
PRs #11-#35, all merged. The rest was dropped rather than carried:

- **Chat blocks** (`send-chat`, the `players-in-system-above` condition, `web/src/bridge/social.ts`
  and their tests). Upstream retired companion chat on purpose (`e500758 feat(web): retire companion
  chat`); the 2026-09-28 sync had kept ours. Dropped to follow upstream: saved bots using either
  are now refused on load with upstream's retired-feature message.
- **Comment drift**: a dated incident note in `compose.yaml`, leftover hunt/`engagePrey` comments
  in `flow.ts` and `fleetCompanionLoop.ts`, and chat wording in `PanelHost.svelte`. Upstream's
  wording taken.
- The 25 local feature branches of the `up/*` era, every one of them absorbed upstream; they
  stay reachable from the tag.
