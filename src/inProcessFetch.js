// A fetch for whoever asks the BFF from inside the BFF's own process.
//
// The hosted bots (src/botHost.js) run the page's own flows in this process,
// and those flows ask the BFF with `fetch`. They did so over loopback HTTP: a
// connection from the process to itself for every request, and one held open
// for each bot's event stream. This is a function of `fetch`'s own shape that
// hands the request to the app where it is (`dispatchInProcess`,
// src/pilotSocket.js) and answers with a `Response` made of what the route
// answered. The flows cannot tell the difference and no route is changed. It
// is the plan's Phase 6a for the bots: the same operations, in process
// (docs/game-port-transport-plan.md).
//
// WHAT IS RUN IN PROCESS. A request to the BFF's own API (`/api/...`) at the
// BFF's own address (`baseUrl`), with a body that is text or absent. The event
// stream is run with `streamInProcess` and answered with a body that is read
// as the route writes it, which is what the hosted event source reads
// (src/hostedEventSource.js).
//
// WHAT IS NOT. Anything else is handed to the fetch given, unchanged: another
// address, a path that is not the API's, a request made of a `Request`, a body
// that is not text.
//
// ONE ANSWER IS NOT THE SAME, and it is no route's. A path no route has is
// answered 404 both ways; over HTTP the body is the app's own last page, and in
// process it is the refusal `dispatchInProcess` gives for it
// (`{ ok: false, error: "NOT_FOUND" }`), as on the tab's socket.
//
// A REQUEST GIVEN UP ON (its signal aborted) rejects with the signal's reason,
// as a fetch does. Its route is not stopped by that, as it is not stopped by a
// connection that closes. An event stream given up on is let go: its request
// is told it has closed, which is what its route waits for.
