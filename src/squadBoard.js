"use strict";

// Shared, in-process SQUAD BOARD: the one thing a fleet's bots need to say to
// each other while they are shooting — which ship is the primary.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every combat block picks its own target from its own grid
// read (nav/targetPriority.ts ranks it, distance breaks the tie), and each
// pilot is its own browser tab or its own server-bot session. Two pilots on one
// grid therefore converge on the hostile each ranks first FOR ITSELF, which is
// routinely two different ships: three bots each take a third of the damage off
// a rat that dies to none of them. Nothing in the game read tells a client what
// a fleet-mate is shooting — a snapshot row carries position, health, owner and
// type, never a target — so the pilots have to say it themselves.
//
// SHARED, NOT PERSISTED, AND NOT A GAME WRITE. This is BFF-local bookkeeping,
// exactly like src/beltMemory.js: no gateway call in either direction, nothing
// the game validates, nothing that survives a restart. It coordinates clients;
// it does not touch the world. (The in-game equivalent — a fleet broadcast or
// a fleet target tag — is a separate, later job: the write side is plumbed but
// nothing in the client can READ a tag back yet.)
//
// ONE CALL PER FLEET, LAST CALL WINS. There is no queue and no arbitration: the
// FC is whoever spoke most recently, which is what "primary" means over voice
// too. A fleet with two bots both calling is a fleet whose owner asked for
// that.
//
// ⚠ A CALL GOES STALE FAST — SECONDS, NOT HOURS. A belt stays mined out long
// enough for an hour's memory to be useful; a primary stops being one the
// moment it dies, warps off, or the fight ends, and a bot that kept obeying a
// stale call would sit pointing its guns at a wreck instead of re-picking. So
// the ttl here is deliberately short and the entry simply expires — a follower
// then falls back to its own ladder, which is a working bot, not a stopped one.
//
// KEYED BY FLEET, AS AN EXACT DECIMAL STRING. A fleet id is a game id and can
// be larger than 2^53 (a live one already reads 654500010000), so it is never
// coerced through Number here — the caller hands in whatever exact string the
// BFF resolved from the fleet's own GetInitState, and this file only ever
// compares it. Keying by fleet is also the whole access rule: a session can
// only read or write the board of the fleet the SERVER resolved for it, so one
// operator's fleets cannot see each other's calls, let alone another account's.
//
// PURE. No I/O, no timers of its own — `now` is injected so tests control the
// clock exactly, the same shape as src/beltMemory.js and src/accountCache.js.
