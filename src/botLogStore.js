"use strict";

// The bot flight recorder's storage: one log per CHARACTER, rotated when a run
// starts, so the current run and the one before it are always on disk.
//
// WHY PER CHARACTER. A character is what flies. The question an operator
// actually asks is "what did this pilot do", across whatever script happened to
// be running — not "what did script X do", which could be three pilots at once.
//
// WHY TWO. The question is nearly always "what happened in the run that just
// ended", and occasionally "the one before, which was fine". A third file earns
// nothing and a directory that grows forever earns less than nothing. A run's
// `start` line is the rotation signal: current becomes previous, previous is
// dropped, and the new run writes from an empty file.
//
// ⚠ THE RECORDER IS NEVER LOAD-BEARING. Every failure here — a full disk, a
// path that cannot be created, a file that will not open — is swallowed and
// counted. A ship must never stop because its diary could not be written. That
// is the same promise the runner makes on the other side of the wire
// (web/src/nav/botLog.ts, rule 4), and both halves have to keep it for it to
// mean anything.
//
// BOUNDED AT THE OLD END, NEVER THE NEW ONE.
//
// ⚠ THIS USED TO CAP THE RUN AND STOP WRITING, AND THAT COST A DIAGNOSIS.
// A five-pilot mining run filled its 5000 lines about four and a half hours in,
// wrote one "truncated" line, and recorded nothing for the SEVEN HOURS after —
// including the stop everyone later wanted to read about. The end of a run is
// the part an operator asks for; it was the one part the cap threw away.
//
// So the window rolls: lines always land, and once the file has drifted past
// its ceiling the OLDEST are dropped and a single head line says how many. The
// newest `maxLines` lines are what a reader gets, which is what "what just
// happened to this pilot" needs. A log that silently stops recording is worse
// than one that says it stopped — and a log that keeps the beginning of a
// twelve-hour run instead of its end is worse than both.
//
// THE REWRITE IS AMORTISED, not per line: the file is allowed to grow to twice
// the ceiling and is then compacted in one pass, so a bot mining all day pays
// for one read-and-rewrite every `maxLines` lines instead of one per tick.
// `read` caps what it hands back either way, so the slack is never visible.
//
// NOT A GAME ARTIFACT. These lines name ids on purpose (see botLog.ts): they
// are the operator's own diagnostic file, written under the BFF's data dir,
// never served into the game UI's player-facing copy and never committed.
