// THE SEAM: the route's REAL bytes, through the REAL decoder, into a REAL plan.
//
// test/piSchematics.test.js proves the route serves the documented shape.
// web/src/bridge/piRecipes.test.ts proves the decoder reads that shape.
// web/src/bridge/piChain*.test.ts prove the resolver's arithmetic.
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE CAN PASS WHILE THE FEATURE IS BROKEN. Each of them describes the
// wire shape in its own words — the route's tests from the route's side, the
// client's tests from a table they shape themselves — and two descriptions of
// one contract are exactly how a field gets renamed on one side only. Nothing
// above ever feeds the bytes the server actually sends into the code that
// actually has to read them.
//
// This file does. It boots the BFF, fetches the route, hands the response
// straight to `decodeRecipeBook`, and walks a real chain out the other end. If
// the two halves ever stop agreeing, this is the test that goes red.
//
// (The client modules are TypeScript; node runs them under `require` directly,
// which is why a CommonJS test can hold both halves at once.)
