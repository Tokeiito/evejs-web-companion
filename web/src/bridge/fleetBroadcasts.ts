// Fleet broadcasts and fleet state tags: the two pushed-notification shapes a
// following pilot's bot reads to decide what to do next. Kept in one module
// because they answer the same question from two angles — a broadcast is a
// one-shot CALL ("do this now"), a state-change tag is standing FLEET STATE
// ("this is what X currently is") — and a decoder for one is easy to mistake
// for the other if they are not read side by side.
//
// Wire contract (fleetRuntime.js:2538, cross-checked against the decompiled
// client's own `def OnFleetBroadcast(self, name, scope, charID,
// solarSystemID, itemID, typeID)`):
//   OnFleetBroadcast args = [name, scope, senderCharID, senderSolarSystemID,
//   itemID, typeID], six positional elements, always in that order. `name`
//   is one of the 15 FLEET_BROADCAST_NAMES below; the server refuses
//   ("Illegal broadcast") anything else before it is ever sent
//   (fleetConstants.js:58), so an unrecognised name here means we are
//   decoding garbage, not a legal 16th kind.
//
// OnFleetStateChange has ONE argument, a util.KeyVal whose `targetTags`
// field holds the itemID -> tag dict (fleetPayloads.js:207-211; both server
// call sites share the identical builder).
//
// ⚠ `itemID` and `typeID` skip server-side normalization entirely — they are
// passed through from the sending client untouched (unlike senderCharID and
// senderSolarSystemID, which the server does normalize). Our web client
// receives notifications through the web gateway's `encodeJsonSafeCallValue`,
// which turns any `bigint` into `.toString()` — a BARE DECIMAL STRING, not a
// `{type:"long"}` wrapper. A previous investigation concluded a bare numeric
// string could not happen here and was wrong: it traced the binary marshal
// path used by the retail client, not the JSON path our gateway actually
// serves. So itemID/typeID must tolerate a number, null, OR a bare numeric
// string — see positiveSafeID below, and its dedicated test.
