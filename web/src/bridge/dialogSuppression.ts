// _handle_player_fsd_dialog, 48 to 93; _prompt_player and _persist_prompt_suppress_choice, 96 to 135):
//
//   a dialog the install marks suppressable (dialogs.static's suppressable) is shown with a checkbox, worded
//   "/Carbon/UI/Common/DoNotAskAgain" where it asks a question and "DoNotShowAgain" where it only tells
//   (eve/client/script/ui/shared/messagebox.py prompt_player, 158 to 190);
//   ticked, and answered with the answer the call keeps (its suppress argument, else the dialog's own), that answer
//   is kept in the user's settings (settings.user.suppress, 'suppress.' and the dialog's name);
//   asked again with an answer kept, the dialog is not shown and the call's suppress argument is its answer.

// The dialogs the page asks that the client asks with suppress=uiconst.ID_YES, so that Yes alone is kept: the mail
// window's folder and list writes (evemail.py 1116 to 1158), the notification window's four (neocom/notifications.py
// 233 to 246; notificationSvc.py 223), a bookmark's removal (addressbookService.py DeleteBookmarks, 457 and 459), and
// the Locations window's folders and subfolders (bookmarksPanel.py DeleteACLFolder, ForgetFolder, DeleteSubfolder and
// CreateSubfolder, 435 to 487; locations/window.py _create_sub_folder, 152), the folder window's two before a
// folder is made offline or with a name another has (bookmarkContainerWindow.py Confirm, 231 to 237), and the
// scanner's warning before a scan in Abyssal space (scanSvc.RequestScans_Check, 183 to 187), and the probe results'
// filter's delete (probeScannerPalette.DeleteFilter, 554), a grouped weapon's unfitting (fittingSlotController.UnfitModule,
// 230), and a module put offline from its rack button (shipmodulebutton._ChangeOnline, 830).
