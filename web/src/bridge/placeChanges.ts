// The pilot's changes of place that the page makes itself: the session going from a station into space, and on.
//
// UNDOCKED. The station's undock (ui/station/base.py, _DoUndockAttempt, 488 to 521):
//
//   onlineModules = clientDogmaIM.GetDogmaLocation().GetOnlineModules(shipID)
//   sm.GetService('sessionMgr').PerformSessionChange('undock', shipsvc.Undock, shipID, ignoreContraband,
//                                                    onlineModules=onlineModules)
//
// shipsvc is gameui.GetShipAccess(), the ship's object for the station; the ship is the session's own, the one the
// undocking service hands over (undockingSvc.py 121 to 135). First with ignoreContraband False: a ship carrying
// what the local law forbids is refused with ShipContrabandWarningUndock, the pilot is asked (OK / Cancel), and on
// OK the undock is made again with it True (506 to 511). The client's session manager makes the call only when no
// other session change is under way and the last one's timer has run, and the session is another one after it.
//
// THE SESSION CHANGE IS KEPT BY THE BFF, as the client's session manager keeps it: the change claimed, the call
// made, and the answer given once the ship is usable in space (src/server.js, the generic call's place changes;
// bridgeCallPolicy.js, PAGE_PLACE_CHANGE_CALLS). A refusal for contraband comes back as CONTRABAND_WARNING, in the
// words of the client's own dialog where the BFF has them.
//
// UNDOCKED FROM A PLAYER STRUCTURE (since 2026-10-14; until then the station's ship.Undock, which this server takes
// from a structure too). The client's structure docking service (structureDocking.py, Undock 26 to 51) asks
//
//   sm.GetService('sessionMgr').PerformSessionChange('undock', TryUndockOnServer, doIgnoreContraband=...)
//   ... sm.RemoteSvc('structureDocking').Undock(session.structureid, shipID, ignoreContraband=doIgnoreContraband)
//
// the structure's own service, by its name, with the structure the session is docked in and the ship (None where the
// ship is the structure, a pilot controlling it); ignoreContraband a keyword, false first and true once the pilot
// has said to go on, as at a station (37 to 45). No online modules are named. The same keeping as the station's.
//
// THE ONLINE MODULES ARE NOT THE PAGE'S TO NAME: godma's list is the client's, and the game port names it
// (src/gamePort/retailCalls.js, undocking). The page sends none, as its route sent none; the server leaves the
// modules as they are where none are named (shipService._syncRequestedOnlineModulesForUndock).
//
// DOCKED AT A STATION. The menu's dock (menusvc.DockStation, 2991 to 2997, through GetCloseAndTryCommand, which flies
// the ship close first) and the flight's dock-or-jump (movementFunctions.DockOrJumpOrActivateGate, 346 on, for a
// thing of the station group) both come to movementFunctions.RealDock (503 to 518):
//
//   sm.GetService('sessionMgr').PerformSessionChange('dock', bp.CmdDock, itemID, session.shipid)
//
// bp the ballpark's own object. The same keeping as the undock's, the BFF's; but a dock the server takes and does
// not carry out (the ship not yet close enough, still landing from a warp) answers nothing all the same, so the BFF
// waits only a short while for the ship to be docked, and answers either way: the page reads the flight after, and
// the autopilot docks again where the ship is still in space.
//
// ⚠ A STRUCTURE IS DOCKED AT ANOTHER WAY: structureDocking.Dock(structureID, session.shipid), asked of the service
// by its name once the ship is close (structureDocking.py 64 to 80): dockAtStructure, below.

//
// THROUGH A STARGATE. The menu's jump (menusvc.StargateJump, 3025 on, flying the ship close first) comes to the gate
// jump service (stargate/client/gateJumpSvc.py, JumpThroughGate, 98 to 127):
//
//   self.sessionMgr.PerformSessionChange(..., remoteBallpark.CmdStargateJump, stargateID, beaconID, session.shipid)
//
// beaconID the gate's own far gate, off its slim item (jumps[0].toCelestialID: movementFunctions.DockOrJumpOrActivateGate,
// 360 to 366); the autopilot's the same (autopilot.py 358). The page names the far gate where its caller knows it, and
// none (nought) where it does not, a fleet's broadcast naming only the gate: the game port names the slim item's then,
// as the client does, and the server works it out from the gate itself (src/gamePort/retailCalls.js). The same
// keeping as the undock's, the BFF's, which binds the park again in the new system before it answers.
