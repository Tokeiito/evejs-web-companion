// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SAME HOLDINGS AS PLANETARY INDUSTRY.
//
// A unit held is a `Holding` (bridge/piStock.ts): so much of one type, in one
// place, belonging to one pilot or corporation, read at one instant. Holdings
// are never merged across places; the resolver is handed the per-type sum, and
// the screen keeps every place so a unit is always said with where it sits.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CORP STOCK ALWAYS COUNTS. A solo player's corporation hangar is theirs; there
// is no switch to leave it out. It is shown apart from personal hangars, but it
// is in the sum.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SEVERAL READS ARE SEVERAL MOMENTS. Pilots are read one account at a time and
// the corp through whoever answers; when those instants are far apart the plan
// says so, rather than presenting the sum as one moment.
