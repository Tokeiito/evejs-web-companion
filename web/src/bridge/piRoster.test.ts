// R108 slice 3: the PI Manager's read, decoded — GET /api/roster/planets.
//
// The payload shape is the route's own (test/rosterPlanets.test.js pins that
// side; test/rosterPlanetsDecode.test.js feeds the route's real bytes through
// this decoder). What is checked here, and why each matters:
//
//   1. EVERY PILOT KEEPS ITS OWN READ-AT. Several pilots read at different
//      moments are not one moment, and a board that lost the per-pilot instant
//      could only ever present them as if they were.
//
//   2. THE CLOCK CORRECTION IS THE ENVELOPE'S. A pilot's read-at is when that
//      pilot was read; the browser's clock is corrected against the one sample
//      taken as the answer left, never against a pilot read earlier in it.
//
//   3. NOT ANSWERED IS NOT EMPTY. A pilot the route left out could not be read;
//      the board says so for THAT pilot, and does not say "has not built".
