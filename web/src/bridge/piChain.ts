// The chain resolver: given a target commodity and a quantity, expand its
// recipe down to the leaves and say what each step needs (goal R108 slice 1).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A RUN IS ATOMIC, AND THE CEILING SAYS SO.
//
// You cannot run a factory four fifths of the way. `needed` is what the next
// step up actually requires; `runs` is `needed` rounded UP to a whole number
// of cycles; `produced` is what those whole runs actually yield, which is
// often more than `needed`. Asking piRecipes.ts's own example for 1
// Superconductor still costs a full run of 5 — the surplus is real and must
// stay visible, never be silently dropped by rounding `needed` itself.
//
// Every child's `needed` is `runs * input.quantity`, not `needed *
// input.quantity` — the ceiling has already been taken at this node, and
// taking it again from the wrong number would double-round.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A LEAF IS A FACT, NOT A FAILURE.
//
// A type nothing in the book makes — a raw resource, or a target the caller
// just made up — is a valid answer: "nothing you own makes this" is exactly
// what a planner needs rendered. Only a nonsensical REQUEST (a bad quantity,
// a bad target id) is null. See piRecipes.ts's own header: null, never zero,
// and here that extends to "leaf, never null".
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TREE IS A TREE. PRODUCTION IS NOT.
//
// ⚠ `resolveChain` RETURNS A SHAPE TO RENDER, NOT A PLAN TO FOLLOW, and the
// difference is a real number on a real screen. A commodity that two branches
// both need appears twice in the tree, and each of those nodes rounds up to
// whole runs on its own. Two branches each needing 2 of something made 5 at a
// time come out as two runs producing 10 — when ONE run of 5 covers both.
//
// This is not hypothetical: in the real table Supercomputers reaches Water down
// two separate paths. So a caller that adds up `runs` or `runSeconds` across the
// tree will overstate the work, and it will overstate it MORE the more the
// chain shares. `chainTotals` is safe — it sums `needed`, which is a
// requirement and not a rounding — but anything about runs, time or the inputs
// those runs consume must come from `planProduction`, which consolidates each
// commodity ONCE across the whole chain and then rounds.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PATH GUARD IS FOR CORRUPT DATA, NOT REAL DATA.
//
// Every row in the real table has exactly one output and the tiers form a
// strict hierarchy (piRecipes.ts's ONE OUTPUT, AND ONLY ONE RECIPE MAKES IT),
// so a real chain cannot cycle. This guard exists anyway, for a hand-edited or
// hostile table: it carries the set of typeIDs on the CURRENT PATH from the
// root, and the moment a type recurs on its own path, that node is treated as
// a leaf instead of being expanded again. A depth cap backs it up for a chain
// that grows without ever repeating a typeID — 8 levels is generous, since the
// real tree bottoms out at 5.
