// A place in space bookmarked by the page itself (the plan's Phase 6b).
//
// Until 2026-10-11 it was one route of the BFF (POST /api/bridge/flight/bookmark-location).
//
// THE CALL, as the client makes it (bookmarkSvc.ACLBookmarkLocation, 609 to 620), from the bookmark's window
// (bookmarkLocationWindow.Confirm, 211: a name of nothing is refused there, and a tab in it is made a space):
//
//   bp = sm.StartService('michelle').GetRemotePark()
//   bp.BookmarkLocation(itemID, folderID, name, comment, expiry, subfolderID=subfolderID)
//
// on the ballpark's own object, the subfolder by keyword every time and None where there is none. With no
// ballpark the client says it must be in flight and asks nothing. A region, a constellation, a system, a station
// or a structure is not asked of the park at all: accessGroupBookmarkMgr's BookmarkStaticLocation is (613), which
// the page does not ask. The thing is the pilot's own ship for "save location"
// (addressbookService.BookmarkCurrentLocation, 394), or anything on the grid, from its menu. No Tranquility
// recording has a bookmark made.
//
// THE PAGE ASKS IT OF BEYONCE BY ITS NAME, as it asks the park's other calls: the game port makes it on the
// park's object, and refuses it for a pilot with none (src/gamePort/retailCalls.js, ON_THE_PARK).
//
// WHAT THE SERVER TAKES FROM THE CALLER: the thing, which it looks for in the session's own scene (the pilot's
// ship, or another thing there; BookmarkNotAvailable otherwise), and the folder, which the session's own
// character must be able to write to (BookmarkFolderNoLongerThere, FolderAccessDenied, FolderCapacityExceeded,
// BookmarkSubfolderNoLongerThere). It answers the bookmark as eight values, its number first.
//
// ⚠ THE ANSWER IS NOT WHAT A CALLER GOES BY. The page's one caller reads its bookmarks again and looks for the
// bookmark there (nav/siteLogisticsBookmark.ts).
