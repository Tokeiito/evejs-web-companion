// R103 Phase-4 BOUND WRITE acks — WB-BEYONCE: the 7 nav/bookmark writes
// (CmdGotoPoint / CmdGotoBookmark / CmdAbandonLoot / CmdFleetTagTarget /
// CmdJumpThroughFleet / BookmarkLocation / BookmarkScanResult) that hang off the
// R5a beyonce remote-park bind (Moniker("beyonce", solarSystemID)). PLUMBING ONLY
// — no UI.
//
// Each write dispatches as a BOUND method off parkBindSpec(solarSystemID) — the
// BFF reads the session's OWN live flight to recover the current system, binds the
// park, and holds the OID handle (the browser never sees it), NOT the top-level
// /call seam. Every BFF route is confirm-gated (refuses without `confirm:true`),
// requires the ship in space, and folds the server return into the uniform ack
// `{ok, applied, result, flight, notifications}` (dispatchBoundBeyonceWrite in
// server.js — it re-reads flight after the write, so the ack also carries the
// updated flight snapshot).
//
// ⚠ OWNERSHIP: every handler resolves ship / scene / char from the SESSION;
// CmdJumpThroughFleet's (charID, shipID) name a fleet-mate's bridge but are
// validated against the session's own fleet membership — no caller-forgeable
// foreign ship. No arg-injection flag.
//
// ⚠ FAST-MODE / educated guess: none fired live this batch (operator owns EveJS;
// no server restart), so this decoder was written from the beyonce handler code,
// not captured bytes. The Cmd* nav handlers return null; the two Bookmark* writers
// return the new bookmark id — `result` carries each through UNTOUCHED for a future
// nav/bookmark UI. `applied` is the confirm-gate's did-not-throw signal; a panel
// re-reads the flight snapshot / bookmarks to prove the mutation.
//
// ⚠ These are WRITES: never call a decoder to DRIVE a mutation — the confirm-gated
// BFF route is the only path, and it refuses without `confirm: true`.
