// The wallet's reads, made by whoever shows the wallet (the plan's Phase 6b).
//
// Until 2026-10-10 the page asked one route of the BFF (GET /api/bridge/wallet)
// and the route made five calls of the server. A retail client has no such
// route. Its wallet and account services make the calls, each when it is
// wanted, and keep what they are told
// (eve/client/script/ui/shared/neocom/wallet/walletSvc.py,
// eve/client/script/ui/services/accountsvc.py). This is those services' asking,
// written once for the page and the hosted bots. Each call is made by the
// generic `call` (bridge/callMethod.ts), and so goes on the pilot's socket like
// any other request; the BFF relays it and decides nothing.
//
// THE CALLS, as the client makes them:
//
//   account.GetCashBalance(0)                          walletSvc.py 41: the pilot's own ISK
//   account.GetTransactions(1000, None, None, False)   accountsvc.py 116: the pilot's own, this month, of
//                                                      its cash (accountingKeyCash)
//   account.GetEntryTypes()                            accountsvc.py 98: the names of an entry's kinds,
//                                                      asked once and kept (GetStaticData)
//   account.GetWalletDivisionsInfo()                   accountsvc.py 132: the corporation's divisions
//   corpRegistry.GetCorporation()                      the corporation's own row, for its wallet divisions' names
//
// On Tranquility (Archive/Open Wallet - Plex - Corp Wallet - Corp Transfers) a
// wallet opened is GetTransactions(1000, None, None, False) and GetEntryTypes()
// once, with the balance already had from the login.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT, as those services keep it, so that several windows that want the
// wallet together ask for each thing once:
//
//   the pilot's ISK      asked once (walletSvc.py 41), and from then on what the server says it is
//                        (OnAccountChange('cash', charID, balance); walletSvc.py 80, 91)
//   the transactions     until the server says any account changed (accountsvc.py 64, 108)
//   the entry kinds      for as long as the pilot is this one (accountsvc.py 86)
//   the divisions        five minutes (accountsvc.py 132). The client also works a division's new balance
//                        into what it shows; here a change to one of the corporation's accounts forgets the
//                        divisions, which asks sooner than the client and is never behind it
//   the corporation      until the server says it changed (bco_corporations.py 42, 79)
//
// An asking that fails is not kept. A read asked for afresh (the window's own
// Refresh, which the client has no need of) forgets all of it but the kinds.
// `cash()` is not kept at all: it is a guard's asking, of the server each time.
//
// THE ROUTE STILL STANDS (src/server.js). Nothing of the page's asks it now.
