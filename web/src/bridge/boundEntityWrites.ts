// R102 Phase-4 BOUND WRITE acks — WB-ENTITY: the 4 drone-command writes
// (CmdReturnHome / CmdSalvage / CmdAbandonDrone / CmdReconnectToDrones) that hang
// off the R72 entity.MachoBindObject bind. PLUMBING ONLY — no UI.
//
// Each write dispatches as a BOUND Cmd* method off entityBindSpec() (the same
// bound two-step the dogma writes use — the BFF holds the OID handle, the browser
// never sees it), NOT the top-level /call seam. Every BFF route is confirm-gated
// (refuses without `confirm:true`) and folds the server return into the uniform
// ack `{ok, applied, result, notifications}` (dispatchBoundEntityWrite in
// server.js). ⚠ CmdAbandonDrone PERMANENTLY DISOWNS the drones — its route carries
// an extra-explicit confirm message.
//
// ⚠ FAST-MODE / educated guess: none fired live this batch (operator owns EveJS;
// no server restart), so this decoder was written from the droneRuntime handler
// code, not captured bytes. Every command returns a per-drone MULTI-RESULT dict
// (buildMultiDroneResult — a map of droneID → outcome/error), and `result` carries
// it through UNTOUCHED for a future drone UI to decode. `applied` is the confirm-
// gate's did-not-throw signal; a panel re-reads the space snapshot to prove it.
//
// ⚠ These are WRITES: never call a decoder to DRIVE a mutation — the confirm-gated
// BFF route is the only path, and it refuses without `confirm: true`.
