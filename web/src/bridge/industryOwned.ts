//
// The resolver takes one set of terms per blueprint type. When pilots hold
// several of the same blueprint, the plan is worked at the best of them
// (highest material efficiency, then time efficiency, an original before a
// copy): that is the one a player would install. Which pilot holds it is kept
// for the row that names it.
