// Where a picked-up stack should go on THIS hull — the bot's side of the
// "which bay?" question the inventory panel answers with a drag.
//
// ── THE RULE THIS FILE INHERITS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `holdFit.ts` states the operator's standing rule for holds: the SERVER judges
// validity (can this type go in this bay at all), and the browser only decides
// what to ASK for. This module keeps that rule. The table below is a
// PREFERENCE, never a verdict:
//
//   * a type the table does not know goes to the cargo hold;
//   * a bay the hull does not have goes to the next choice, then to cargo;
//   * a bay that REFUSES goes to the cargo hold (the caller retries there).
//
// So a wrong or incomplete row in `BAY_PREFERENCES` costs one refused call and
// a cargo-bound retry. It can never strand loot.
//
// ── THE SERVER DOES ENFORCE ELIGIBILITY, AND THIS FILE USED TO SAY IT DID NOT ─
//
// ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-09-15, BY A LIVE REFUSAL. A hauler loading command centres
// was told, in the server's own words:
//
//     "Only planetary resources and commodities can be placed in the Planetary
//      Commodities Hold."
//
// The old text here reasoned from `refusals.ts` — whose enumerated UserError
// codes carry `NotEnoughCargoSpace` and no wrong-type code — that a bay refuses
// on CAPACITY and nothing else, and that a wrong row therefore cost nothing.
// Both halves were wrong. The check does not raise a UserError at all: the
// inventory broker answers the move with `SHIP_BAY_ITEM_NOT_ALLOWED` and a
// sentence naming the hold, which is why it was invisible to an audit of throw
// sites.
//
// A wrong row is therefore NOT cheap. It is a refusal per attempt, and a block
// that keeps asking spends its whole budget and stops the run.
//
// ⚠ SO A ROW IS CHECKED AGAINST THE SERVER'S OWN TABLE, NEVER GUESSED FROM A
// NAME. The authority is the emulator's `specialShipHoldRegistry.js`
// (`isSpecialShipHoldItemAllowed`), which is itself transcribed from the retail
// client's `inventoryFlagsCommon.py` and cites it. What it says about the two
// holds this file gets asked about most:
//
//   • the command centre hold (flag 148) takes GROUP 1027 and nothing else;
//   • the planetary commodities hold (flag 149) takes CATEGORY 42 (Planetary
//     Resources) and 43 (Planetary Commodities), plus Water and Oxygen.
//
// Command centres are group 1027 in CATEGORY 41 — Planetary Interaction, the
// PI *structures* — so they are eligible for the first and refused by the
// second. That one category is the whole of the bug: the table sent the
// overflow of a full command centre hold into the planetary hold next door,
// which looks obviously right and is obviously wrong.
//
// The mining holds (134 ore, 135 gas, 181 ice, 182 asteroid) are `managedBy`
// the mining service rather than this generic check, which is why ice in a
// mining hold has always worked.
//
// It remains a PREFERENCE and not a verdict — the server still judges, and an
// unknown type still goes to cargo — but "the server will not stop us" is no
// longer a reason to write a row on taste.
//
// ── WHY NOT JUST PUT EVERYTHING IN CARGO ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Because that is what caused the bug this module exists to fix. A mining or
// hauling hull's cargo hold is tiny next to its ore hold, so ore-bearing loot
// trickled in a few units at a time. Routing by bay is what makes a hauler's
// specialised space usable at all.

 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS NOT "EVERY BAY". A ship's KIT lives in bays too — drones, jump

 * unload that stripped those would turn a drop-off into a stranding, and a
 * pickup that filled them would spend the ship's own reserves on loot. So the

 *

 * treated as kit, even though a Hoarder's 41,000 m³ ammo hold is plainly
 * freight to somebody hauling charges for a living. There is no way to tell
 * those two cases apart from the bay alone, and the safe default is the one
 * that cannot disarm a ship. A block argument to opt in belongs on the
