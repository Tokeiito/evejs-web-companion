// sentences across engage / mine / salvage / scoop / recall, every one of them
// already plain player language. The BFF used to forward only the
// notifications, so all thirteen were thrown away before the browser ever saw
// them. R33's client-side prediction exists because of that loss, not because
// the server had nothing to say.

// reword. It hands the server's sentence back verbatim. Turning it into what
// the player reads is `describeRefusal`'s job (R31 — the one seam where a
// refusal becomes words), and the sentences pass through it untouched because
