// A market order taken down by the page itself (the plan's Phase 6b).
//
// Until 2026-10-13 it was one route of the BFF (POST /api/bridge/market/cancel), which read the pilot's orders and
// wallet, made the call, read both again, and answered whether an order had gone and what the wallet had moved by.
//
// THE CALL, as the client makes it, from an order's own menu in the orders window and in the market's own lists
// ("Cancel Order": orders.py 277 and 304 to 306, entries.py 126 and 152 to 153):
//
//   marketutils.CancelOffer(order)                     quote.py 298 to 303
//     sm.GetService('marketQuote').CancelOrder(order.orderID, order.regionID)
//       self.GetMarketProxy().CancelCharOrder(orderID, regionID)      marketsvc.py 281 to 283
//
// the order's number and the region it is in, both off the order's own row in the pilot's orders. The client asks
// its pilot first (CancelMarketOrder, a yes or no, quote.py 300 to 301), and does nothing after: the server tells
// that the pilot's orders changed (OnOwnOrdersChanged), and the client's market service reads them again. No
// Tranquility recording has an order cancelled.
//
// THE PAGE'S WINDOW ASKS ITS PILOT FIRST, as it did, and says that the broker's fee is not returned.
//
// WHAT THE SERVER TAKES FROM THE CALLER: the order's number. It loads the order, which must be the session's own
// character's, and takes the region from the order itself: the region the call names is not read. It answers
// nothing, whether an order was taken down or was closed already.
//
// ⚠ THE ANSWER IS NOTHING, SO THE VERDICT IS READ: the pilot's orders and its wallet, before the call and after.
// An order that was among the pilot's and is no more was taken down; the wallet's difference is what it returned.
// A read that fails leaves its half of the verdict unknown, and is not made up.
