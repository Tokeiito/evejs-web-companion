 * R34 against the running emulator.
 *
 * ⚠ THE `type` TAGS ARE REAL AND THE FIXTURE MUST CARRY THEM. R33's writeup
 * quoted this payload WITHOUT them, and a decoder built to that quote would
 * have been tested against a shape the server does not send. The measured wire
 * keeps `{"type":"dict"}` on both dicts. The decoder ignores the tag and reads
 * `entries` either way — which is why the untagged variant is pinned
 * separately below rather than assumed to be the only shape.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE CALL ANSWERED 200 WITH ZERO NOTIFICATIONS. That is the whole
 * defect in one line: the only channel the BFF forwarded was empty, and the
