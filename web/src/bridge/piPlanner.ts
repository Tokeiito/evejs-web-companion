// The planner (goal R108 slice 5): can what you hold and what your colonies
// make produce N of X — and if not, exactly where the gaps are.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HELD STOCK IS TAKEN OFF BEFORE INPUTS ARE WORKED OUT.
//
// `planProduction` (piChain.ts) expands the whole requirement. A player who
// already holds 12 of the 20 Consumer Electronics needs the inputs for 8, not
// for 20 — so this does the netting a materials plan does: walk the chain from
// the target down, and at every commodity subtract what is held BEFORE taking
// the whole runs and pushing demand onto its inputs. The walk order and the
// consolidation are planProduction's, for its reason: a commodity two branches
// share is netted and rounded ONCE, against its whole-chain need.
//
// Held means everywhere: colony storage, personal hangars and corporation
// hangars all count — except what already sits in a factory's input buffer,
// which is committed to the recipe that factory runs. Where each unit sits is kept on the row, because stock in
// a station hangar needs a hauler before a factory can use it — the plan says
// so by naming the place, and does not pretend to move it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTHING HERE SIMULATES A COLONY.
//
// A factory rate is recipe arithmetic — one run's output per cycle — and is
// labelled "up to", because a factory only runs when fed. An extractor rate is
// the server's own `quantityPerCycle` over its cycle, for the program
// installed NOW; yield decays across a program, and that curve is the
// emulator's, so the words say which program the number belongs to. No rate is
// ever summed into a time for the whole chain: steps overlap, and pretending to
// schedule them would be a simulation.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// GAPS, IN THE ORDER THEY ARE WORTH TELLING SOMEONE.
//
//   1. nothing you own makes this — no factory anywhere can run its recipe;
//   2. a factory could make this but is making something else — named, with
//      what it makes now;
//   3. it is extracted nowhere you own — naming the colonised planets that
//      carry it, with the server's quality number.
//
// "Made too slowly" is deliberately not a gap: slow is only slow against a
// deadline, and the player chose not to plan against one. Each row says
// instead how long its current producers take to cover what is missing.
//
// With none of these, the verdict is the fifth kind: nothing needs to change.
