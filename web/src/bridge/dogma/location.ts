//                         (of a group, or requiring a skill) that has the attribute; an OwnerRequiredSkillModifier on
//                         what an owner owns that requires the skill. Each modifier's domain is the item it starts from

//   ApplyBrainEffects     the server's brain (eve/common/script/dogma/effect.py BrainEffect: what the pilot's skills

//                         pilot; each from a BrainLiteralAttribute of its value, one for each set of skills and value
//                         (brainLiterals), which no stacking penalty falls on (forceUnnurfed)
//   _ApplyPilotSecurityStatusToShip   the pilot's security status set on the ship (pilotSecurityStatus)
//   FitModuleToShip       a module loaded into a slot of the ship (its location the ship, so its attributes take the
//                         ship's location modifiers as they are made), fitted (RegisterFittedItem) and its passive
//                         effects started; the fitted effects are written in Python (dogma/fitting.py: a turret or a
//                         launcher takes a turret or launcher slot, a rig an upgrade slot and its calibration)
//   OnlineModule          the online effect (ghost fitting's pythonEffects.OnlineEffect: isOnline, the module's CPU
//                         and power added to the ship's loads, no check of either), then each of the module's online
//                         effects (dgmEffOnline) started (_StartEffect)
//   FitAmmoToLocation     a charge loaded into a module's slot: a sublocation of the ship (its key the ship, the flag
//                         and its type), fitted, its passive effects started; a charge is owner-modifiable, so its
//                         attributes take the pilot's owner modifiers (the brain's ORS) as they are made
//   the other item        an effect's otherID: a module's charge in its slot (GetOtherID), a charge's module
//                         (GetSlotOther); a modifier whose item is not there is let go (the Fitting window's
//                         CheckItemsMissingInAddModifier lets it through to _FindOrDefer, and nothing is waiting)
//
// An attribute is made the first time it is asked for (keydefaultdict, itemAttributeFactory) with its type's value or
// its default, and on being made takes the modifiers its item's location and owner hold for it
// (_PickUpInitialModifiers). A modifier from a location reaches only those of its items' attributes made already. A
// ship is fitted to itself but has no location of its own, so an attribute of the ship made after a location modifier
// was put in place never takes it.
//
// An item is loaded with its type's attributes, then its instance row's (GetInstance: the server's instance cache, the
// ship's state; dgmAttributesByIdx, each that is not nought: online, damage, the capacitor's charge, skill points,
// armour damage, the shield's charge, incapacitated), before it is fitted (BaseDogmaItem.Load, _LoadItem).
//
// A charged attribute (dogma/attributes/chargedAttribute.py: one the static data gives a recharge time, the capacitor's
// charge and the shield's) takes no modifier, and runs by the clock (gametime.GetSimTime): made, it is its type's value
// held to its cap; set, it is what it is set to from then on; each time it is read, and each time its cap or its
// recharge time changes, it is brought up to that moment: scaled with its cap where the cap has changed, then
// recharged by the time since it was last brought up, the root of its share of the cap closing on one by
// exp(-t / (recharge time / 5)); at its cap or above it is its cap. (The client marks it dirty whenever anything its
// cap or recharge time is reckoned from changes; here it is brought up where the cap's or the recharge time's value
// has changed.)
//
// An effect is started (StartEffect: ChangeModuleStatus) and stopped (StopEffect) on an item: its Python version where
// the Fitting window's effect compiler has one (GhostFittingEffectCompiler on ClientEffectCompiler: PYTHON_EFFECTS),
// else its modifierInfo's modifiers (ModifierEffect), else nothing (NEUTRAL_EFFECT). Before it starts, the checks the
// Fitting window makes (StartEffect_PreChecks: an online module too damaged; an activated one blocked, or one more of
// its group than may be active; the Python effect's own PreStartChecks), each a UserError (DogmaUserError). The online
// effect starts the type's online effects after it, and stopping it stops every other running effect with no duration.
// A modifier is let go as it was put in place (RemoveModifier and the location and owner kinds).
//
// Not yet (later parts): the command bursts' buffs (the buff registry: their effects start as nothing), the subsystems'
// hardpoint and slot effects (Python), fighters, the skill level, heat, security and TiDi attribute classes.
