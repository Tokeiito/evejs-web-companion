// A mail sent by the page itself (the plan's Phase 6b).

// Until 2026-10-14 this was one route of the BFF (POST /api/bridge/mail/send), which held the message to its own
// limits, made the call, and read the sender's mailbox again (SyncMail) for the message. The client:
//
//   the window    the compose window's Send (evemail.py, ClickSend, 2245 to 2290): a recipient at least, else the
//                 pilot is told there is none; no more than mailMaxRecipients (50, appConst.py 1782) — the window
//                 refuses the 51st as it is added (1909 to 1910); a subject, else NoSubject; a subject no longer
//                 than mailMaxSubjectSize (150, 1784), and a body no longer than mailMaxBodySize (8000, 1785), the
//                 two fields' own lengths (1794, 1838)
//   the call      mailSvc.SendMail (959 to 993):
//                   eveMisc.CSPAChargedAction('CSPAMailCheck', self.mailMgr, 'SendMail', toCharacterIDs, toListID,
//                                             toCorpOrAllianceID, title, body, isReplyTo, isForwardedFrom)
//                 the recipients a list, no list and no corporation from the window's plain message, and the message
//                 it answers or forwards, 0 for none (the defaults, 959). Answered the message's number, or None,
//                 where the client does nothing more; with a number it keeps the body and the header itself
//                 (OnMailSent) and reads nothing again.
//
// THE CONTACT COST (eveMisc.CSPAChargedAction, 89 to 101): a server that charges for mail to a pilot raises
// ContactCostNotApproved with the cost, the client asks the pilot to pay, and on yes sends again with
// approvedCost. This server raises none (services/mail, read 2026-10-14), and the page does not ask: such a refusal
// comes to the pilot as the server's word.
//
// No Tranquility recording has a mail sent.
