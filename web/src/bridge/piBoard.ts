// The PI Manager's board (R108 slice 3), as a pure function of what was read.
//
// Several pilots' colonies in one list. Everything a player reads here is a
// sentence built from a server-stated fact; NOTHING HERE SIMULATES A COLONY
// (planets.ts), and nothing here fetches — the window hands this the readings it
// holds and renders what comes back.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A MERGED VIEW IS NOT ONE MOMENT.
//
// Each pilot was read on its own, at its own instant. So every colony row
// carries the age of ITS pilot's reading, and the board says when the rows it
// merged were read far apart. Nothing here presents several readings as if they
// were one snapshot.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FOUR OUTCOMES, PER PILOT.
//
// Being read, could not be read, has not built, and "the server reported no
// colony table" are four facts, and on a board spanning pilots each is said
// about the pilot it is true of. A failed read never erases the last good one:
// that reading stays, aged, beside the sentence saying the new one failed.
