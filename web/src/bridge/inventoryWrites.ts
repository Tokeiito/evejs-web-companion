//
//   the drop       item.py, an item's OnDropData (958 to 1078): each stack of the same type dropped on this one is
//                  (its itemID, this one's itemID, its whole stack, or a number asked with shift held), and the
//                  source is where the dropped stacks lie (`sourceID = node.rec.locationID`, 1004)
//   the window's   invControllers.MultiMerge (327 to 335): the target's container's own controller hands
//                  [(source, destination, qty), ...] and the source on to its inventory
//   the call       invCache's container's MultiMerge (1100 to 1124): self.moniker.MultiMerge(ops, sourceContainerID)
//                  on the inventory the target is in: the hangar's for a stack in the hangar
//                  (invCache.GetInventory(const.containerHangar)), a thing's own for one in a ship or a container
//
// Recorded on Tranquility once ("Unknown Events Level 2"): in the hangar's container, MultiMerge([(source, target,
// 3822)], 60001717), a list of one tuple and the station the dropped stack lay in.
//
// WHAT THE SERVER TAKES FROM THE CALLER (invBrokerService.Handle_MultiMerge, read 2026-10-13): the stacks named and
// the source; in a hangar it moves nothing of a stack that is not the session's own character's, and a ship's or a
// container's inventory is held to whose it is. It answers nothing whether it merged or not: the page reads the
// place again for its verdict.

//
// ITEMS TRASHED. Until 2026-10-13 a route (POST /api/bridge/inventory/trash), which listed the place, sent TrashItems
// on the inventory manager and listed the place again. The client (invItemFunctions.TrashInvItems, 602 to 626): the
// items must lie in one place, the pilot is asked, each must be of a type that may be trashed, and then
//
//   errors = invCache.GetInventoryMgr().TrashItems(itemsToTrash, locationID)
//
// on the inventory manager of where the session is (eveMoniker.GetInventoryMgr, 122 to 131: the solar system's
// where the session has one, else the station's), not on any inventory's own object. `locationID` is the station or
// structure the first item lies in directly, the office's station for a corporation's item, and otherwise the
// place the item lies in, a ship or a container (invCache.GetStationIDOfItem, 660 to 691). Each error answered is

// the ship the pilot is in, a fitted module or anything in space; all of one owner. It answers None, or a list of
// refusals (CannotTrashItem) where it destroys nothing.
