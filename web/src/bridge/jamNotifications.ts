// Jam notifications: who is holding this ship down, and with what.
//
// The server pushes `OnJamStart` to the VICTIM'S OWN SESSION the moment a
// hostile module cycle lands on it, and `OnJamEnd` when the effect drops
// (`space/runtime.js:13127` — `notifyHudJamStateToSession`, reached only via
// `notifyHostileHudStateToSession(targetSession, …)`, i.e. the session of the
// entity being jammed). So the aggressor NAMES ITSELF, on the victim's own
// wire, which is exactly the read "tackle → tag" needs and which no space
// snapshot carries: an earlier pass looked only at `space.ts`, found nothing,
// and wrongly concluded the only signal available was the reactive warp
// refusal.
//
// Wire contract, read off `space/runtime.js:13155` and `:13173`:
//   OnJamStart args = [sourceBallID, moduleID, targetBallID, jammingType,
//                      fileTime, durationMs]   — six positional elements
//   OnJamEnd   args = [sourceBallID, moduleID, targetBallID, jammingType]
//                                              — the same first four, no more
//
// All three ids are `toInt`-normalized server-side before they are sent (unlike
// a broadcast's `itemID`, which is passed through opaquely), and the server
// refuses to send at all unless every one of them is positive and the
// `jammingType` is a non-empty string. They still go through the same
// `positiveSafeID` coercer every bridge decoder uses rather than being trusted
// blind — cheap, and it keeps one shape of id handling across this directory.
//
// ⚠ IT ALREADY REACHES THE BROWSER. The web gateway's notification stub
// suppresses exactly ONE method, `DoDestinyUpdate`
// (`evejsWebGatewayRuntime.js:4031,4357`), and captures every other
// `sendNotification` onto the push stream. `OnJamStart` is not suppressed, so
// this needs no BFF route and no gateway patch — only a decoder, the same
// shape as `fleetBroadcasts.ts`.
//
// ⚠ `args[4]` IS A SERVER FILETIME, NOT A CLIENT CLOCK. It is run through
// `resolveVisibleSessionNotificationFileTime` on the way out, which is the
// retail client's own time base. Nothing here reads it: a jam is stamped with
// the moment the BROWSER received it, the same discipline
// `decodeFleetBroadcastNotification` follows with `receivedAtMs`, so every
// freshness answer in this client comes from one clock.

/**

 * `warpScramblerMWD` is a Warp Scrambler and `warpScrambler` is a Warp
 * Disruptor — the names are the server's and they are, unhelpfully, the wrong
 * way round from how a player says them
 * (`space/modules/hostileModuleRuntime.js:191,203`; the `scram` definition is
 * the one that also carries `blocksMicrowarpdrive`).
 *
 * ⚠ AN ALLOWLIST, NEVER A BLACKLIST. The same notification carries webs
 * (`webify`), target painters, damps, neuts, vampires, tracking and guidance
 * disruptors — nine other types in that one file, and a future server drop may
 * add more. A blacklist would silently start treating some new ewar type as
 * tackle the day it shipped; this fails safe in the other direction, and a
 * missing type shows up as "did not tag" rather than as a fleet-wide letter
