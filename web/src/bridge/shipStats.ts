// Real ship statistics for the fitting window (goal R21, slice B).
//
// WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM
//
// Every value here is a pure function of the attribute map the SERVER already
// sends us in `dogmaIM.ShipGetInfo`. The browser does not simulate dogma and
// does not hold a second opinion about any of it: it promotes what the server
// computed (`1 − resonance`), or does arithmetic whose inputs are entirely
// server values (EHP from HP and resonances, align time from mass and inertia
// using the server's own formula).
//
// THE TRAP, AND WHY WE ARE NOT IN IT
//
// R20 found that `buildShipResourceState()` called bare applies only PASSIVE
// and ONLINE effects — every active module contributes nothing and nothing
// errors, which reads a Drake's EM resist as 20% instead of 61.3% and halves
// its EHP. That trap is real, but it is a trap for a caller INSIDE eve.js.
//
// `ShipGetInfo` is not such a caller. It goes
//   Handle_ShipGetInfo -> _buildShipAttributeDict -> getShipFittingSnapshot
//   -> buildFittingSnapshot -> buildSnapshotResourceState,
// and that last step re-solves with `collectAssumedActiveFittingEffects`
// through `additionalAttributeModifierEntries`, with `assumeActiveShipModules`
// defaulting to true. So the resonances that reach this module ALREADY have
// hardeners applied. `shipStats.test.ts` pins that with the real Drake numbers
// (0.387… not 0.8), so if that call path ever changes underneath us, the suite
// says so instead of the window quietly halving everyone's tank.
//
// WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW
//
// The web gateway allows exactly two fitting reads: `ShipGetInfo` (the SHIP's
// attributes) and `ShipOnlineModules` (which modules are on). Nothing returns
// per-MODULE effective attributes, so anything that must be summed over
// modules — DPS, volley, mining yield, repair rates, capacitor usage — cannot
// be computed here at all. Those are reported as unavailable WITH THE REASON,
// never as zero. A zero in a fitting window is a claim, and we are not
// entitled to make it.
