// R108 slice 3: the PI Manager's board, as a pure function of what was read.
//
// What is checked, and why each matters:
//
//   1. FOUR OUTCOMES, PER PILOT. Being read, could not be read, has not built,
//      and the server reported no colony table are four different facts. On a
//      board spanning pilots each is said about THAT pilot, never collapsed into
//      one message for the whole board.
//
//   2. EVERY ROW CARRIES ITS OWN AGE. Pilots are read at different moments; a
//      merged list says how old each row is and says when they differ.
//
//   3. A FAILED READ DOES NOT ERASE A GOOD ONE. The last reading stays on the
//      board, aged, beside the sentence saying the new one failed.
//
//   4. WORST FIRST ACROSS PILOTS, by the same rule one colony list uses.
//
//   5. NO NUMBER AS DATA (R7d), NO MACHINERY WORDS (R9a).
