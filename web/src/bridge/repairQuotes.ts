// The station repair shop's quote — repairSvc.GetRepairQuotes, decoded.
//
// WHAT THE SHOP ANSWERS
//
// The quote is a dict keyed by the item id we asked about; the value carries an
// `items` list of the damaged parts the shop found on that item. An item the
// shop lists with NO parts is undamaged — that is how "nothing to repair" is
// said on this wire, so an empty list is dropped here rather than rendered as a
// zero-cost repair.
//
// ⚠ THE PRICE IS THE SHOP'S, PRICED THE CLIENT'S WAY. A part row carries no
// total: it carries `damage` (HP) and `costToRepairOneUnitOfDamage`, and the
// retail repair window (repairshop/base_repairshop.py DisplayRepairQuote) prices
// a part as ceil(damage) * that unit cost — the same product the server's
// RepairItems charges (repairRuntime buildRepairExecutionTargets `fullCost`).
// A row that carries neither a `cost` nor both of those has no price, `cost`
// stays null, and the UI says the price is unknown instead of inventing 0 ISK
// next to a button that debits a real wallet. The client also skips a part
// whose ceil(damage) is 0; so do we.
