// Pilot Hangar — the parts of the hangar screen that are the player's own
// ARRANGEMENT rather than the server's facts: squads, which squads sit on the
// chip row, which pilots are pinned inside their account, and which accounts are
// collapsed.
//
// None of this exists on the EveJS server. A squad is a label the player puts on
// a set of their own pilots so a mining op or a scout net can be brought online
// in one action; the server has no idea those pilots belong together. So it all
// lives in localStorage beside knownCharacters.ts (same origin, same "names and
// IDs only, never a secret" rule — see the header there).
//
// Everything below the load/save pair is a PURE function on a prefs value. The
// screen reads one snapshot, hands it to these, and writes the result back; no
// component reaches into storage itself, and every rule is testable without a
// DOM.

// ⚠ THIS NAME DOES NOT EXIST YET AT THE TIME OF WRITING. The codec module is
// being renamed from `decodeFleetCompanionRequestValue` to
// `decodeCompanionSetupValue` (verdict: `{ ok: true; setup: CompanionSetup }`
// or `{ ok: false; refusal: string }`) by the agent that owns
// `bots/companionRunPolicy.ts`, alongside the retired-keys allowance that lets
// an old role/tagging/module-list config still decode. This file calls the new
// name regardless, on the assumption that rename lands alongside this one.

   * migrate, nothing to lose, and membership keeps working exactly as before.
   *
   * ⚠ THE VALUE IS A `CompanionSetup`, NOT A WHOLE REQUEST WITH EMPTY MODULE
   * LISTS ANY MORE. There is no role to pick and nothing here derives modules
   * from a fit -- see docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md. What is stored is
   * exactly `fleeHealthFloor`, `capacitorFloor`, `maxFleeAttempts`,
   * `repairsAtStation`, `droneHealthFloor` and `droneRedeployHoldOffSeconds`;
   * `decodeCompanionSetupValue` is the door on the way out of localStorage, the
   * same door `botHost.start()` trusts, so this file invents no second codec.
   * A companion's eight module lists are never saved anywhere: they are read
   * off the hull it is actually flying when it starts, because an itemID saved
   * here would be stale the moment that pilot refits or changes ship.
   *
   * ⚠ THE PRESENCE OF AN ENTRY IS NOW THE ONLY MARKER THAT A PILOT IS SET UP
   * HERE. A role used to double as "this pilot is a companion in this squad";
   * with no role, that fact is exactly whether `companionConfigFor` returns
   * non-null, and unsetting one means removing the entry (`setCompanionConfig`
   * with `null`), not writing some sentinel into it.
   *
   * ⚠ AND IT IS localStorage, SO IT IS NOT THE AUTHORITY FOR A RUNNING BOT.
   * A headless run outlives the tab; `botHost` persists the request it was
   * STARTED with in its own durable roster row. This map is the template a
   * start is built from, never a live handle on a run.
