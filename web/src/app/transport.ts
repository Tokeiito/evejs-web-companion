// The client's request lane: a concurrency cap, and evidence when it fails
// (goal R92).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// A browser opens about SIX connections per origin over HTTP/1.1 and shares
// them across everything the tab does. Exceeding that does not fail loudly — it
// QUEUES, silently, inside the browser, where this code cannot see it. A queued
// request looks exactly like a slow one from the outside, with one cruel
// difference: the server never receives it, so nothing appears in any log, and
// `AbortSignal.timeout()` counts the queued time and eventually reports a
// timeout against a server that was never asked anything.
//
// That is the failure this module is built around. `skipWhileBusy` removed the
// known cause (five pollers stacking up on a slow server); this is the
// structural guarantee, so the next burst of requests — a bot loop, a panel
// opened during a stall, code not written yet — cannot recreate it.
//
// TWO JOBS, and they are the same bookkeeping:
//
//   1. CAP OUR OWN CONCURRENCY BELOW THE BROWSER'S. If we never have more than
//      MAX_IN_FLIGHT requests outstanding, the browser never has to queue one,
//      so we always know what is happening to every request we made.
//   2. SAY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WHEN ONE FAILS. Because the queue is ours, we
//      know whether a failed request waited for a connection or was sent and
//      ignored — the single most useful fact about a transport failure, and the
//      one no field report has ever contained.
//
// ⚠ PRIORITY IS NOT A NICETY. Without it, a click waits behind whatever polls
// happen to be in the lane. The player's own action is the one request whose
// latency they can feel, so it goes first, always.

/** What kind of request this is. Lower sorts first. */
