// Reading corporation hangars for the PI board (R108 slice 5).
//
// ⚠ THE ONE READ THAT NEEDS A PILOT ONLINE. Colonies and personal hangars come
// from each pilot's gateway snapshot with nobody selected (piRosterRead.ts),
// but corp-owned goods are in no pilot's snapshot: the snapshot is filtered to
// the character as owner. The corp asset read (corpmgr) runs on a HELD session,
// so it is made through a pilot of that corporation who is ALREADY online:
//
//   • online in this tab — riding that pilot's own session
//     (GET /api/bridge/corp-assets);
//   • flown by a server bot of the player's — on the bot's session, through a
//     read-only route that never selects, releases or stops anything
//     (GET /api/bots/corp-assets). The call itself is made as the pilot's
//     ACCOUNT on a throwaway sign-in, the roster read's pattern, signed in only
//     when a bot is actually tried and signed out when the read ends.
//
// Nobody is selected and nobody is brought online. A corp with neither is
// reported as such; the board says so beside the numbers and offers no sign-in.
//
// ⚠ ONE PILOT PER CORPORATION, TRIED IN TURN, THIS TAB'S FIRST. Every member
// reads the same hangars, so the first pilot that answers is the answer. A
// pilot that is refused (no hangar access, a stale session, a bot that just
// ended) is recorded against that pilot and the next one is tried: in a game
// where roles differ, one pilot's refusal must not hide goods another can see.
//
// ⚠ ONE OFFICE AT A TIME, for the reason piRosterRead.ts reads one account at
// a time: the browser allows about six connections per origin, and the player's
// own clicks must not queue behind a sweep.
