// ⚠ NEVER THE ACTIVE PILOT'S. These windows open from the Pilot Hangar with
// nobody in the client, and over a cockpit they are about every pilot. Every
// call they make is scoped server-side to the CALLING account, so each one is
// made by the account it is about:
//
//   • a pilot this tab is flying rides its OWN session. /api/bots/start
//     releases the caller's held session as part of the start, so for a hull
//     this tab holds only that pilot's session can hand it over;
//   • anyone else is reached as their ACCOUNT, through a throwaway sign-in held
//     for as long as the window is open (app/accountPass.ts).
//
// Riding one pilot's token for everybody — what these windows used to do — lists
// one account's bots, and refuses every member of a group on any other account
// with "Character does not belong to the supplied account".
