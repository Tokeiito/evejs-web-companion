// Reading the PI roster's colonies (R108 slice 3) — with NO character selected.
//
// ⚠ A SIGN-IN, NEVER A SELECT. Reading a colony needs only ownership: the
// gateway's /snapshot is gated by validateOwnedCharacter and nothing else
// (proved live, see GET /api/roster/planets in src/server.js). So this does what
// the hangar's roster refresh does (app/rosterRefresh.ts): signs the account in
// on a THROWAWAY token, asks, and signs that token out. A sign-in claims no hull.
// A select would — it applies the character and undocks it, and a bot flying
// that pilot in another tab or on another device, which nothing here can see,
// would lose its ship without a word. Acting on a colony needs a select and so
// goes through the bot host; it never starts here.
//
// ⚠ ONE ACCOUNT AT A TIME, for the hangar refresh's reason: a browser allows
// about six connections per origin, and a dozen sign-ins at once queue the
// player's own clicks behind them.
//
// Every pilot comes back with its own outcome, so the board can say which pilot
// was read, which could not be, and which has no account to read with.
