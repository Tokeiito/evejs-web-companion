// ONE SHIP, ONE BOT (goal R43).
//
// The bug this suite exists to pin: mutual exclusion between the two browser
// decide-loops was TWO HAND-WRITTEN LINES and they were asymmetric.
//
//   flow.ts  startMissionBot -> miningBot?.stop()    ✓
//   flow.ts  startMiningBot  -> autopilot?.abort()   ✗ never stopped missionBot
//
// So starting the mining bot while the mission bot ran left BOTH loops ticking,
// each issuing movement and module calls against the same ship, and neither
// able to see the other. Nothing in the app noticed.
//
// ⚠ THE FIX IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A THIRD LINE. `nav/botRegistry.ts` holds one
// `BotID` union and one exhaustive `Record<BotID, () => void>` of stoppers;
// `createShipClaim` walks EVERY other bot and stops it. A fourth bot cannot be
// added without the compiler demanding its stopper, and it inherits exclusion
// from every existing bot without anyone remembering to write a line. The store
// then carries ONE `runningBotID`, recomputed from the loops' own statuses after
// every event, so the readout can never drift from the loops.
//
// This suite drives the REAL flow over a faked BFF and asserts the property that
// matters: whichever bot you start, exactly one is left running.
