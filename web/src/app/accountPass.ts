// Speaking as an ACCOUNT from a window that belongs to no pilot.
//
// The Bot Manager and the Fleet companions window are global: they open from
// the brand strip on the Pilot Hangar as well as over a cockpit, and a player
// with nobody in the client still has bots to watch and squads to start. Every
// call they make is behind requireAuth and scoped to `req.account.accountID`
// (/api/bots, /api/bots/start, /api/bots/:id/stop, /api/botscripts), so each
// one has to be made BY THE ACCOUNT IT IS ABOUT. All this browser has for an
// account nobody is flying here is its name — and on a server whose login
// takes any password, the name is the credential.
//
// app/stopBotFor.ts and app/startCompanionFor.ts do this per call: sign in,
// act, sign out. That is right for a click. It is wrong for a window that polls
// the roster every three seconds across every account the browser knows — a
// sign-in and a sign-out per account per beat. So this holds ONE throwaway
// token per account for as long as the window is open, mints it on first use,
// and signs every one of them out when the window lets go.
//
// ⚠ A SIGN-IN, NEVER A SELECT. A token minted here selects no character, so it
// undocks nothing and claims no hull (app/piRosterRead.ts has the full
// argument). The bot host mints its own session for a start; this token only
// names the account that asks.
//
// ⚠ NOT FOR A PILOT THIS TAB IS FLYING. /api/bots/start releases the CALLER's
// held session as part of the start; a throwaway token holds nothing, so a
// start for a pilot signed in HERE must ride that pilot's own session or the
// host refuses with "A web session is flying this character". The callers make
// that fork — `ownerOptions` in the Bot Manager — and fall back to this only
// for a pilot no session here holds.
