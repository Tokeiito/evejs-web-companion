// Starting a server companion for a pilot whose account is NOT this tab's.
//
// ⚠ THE SIBLING OF `stopBotFor.ts`, AND ITS HEADER IS THE ARGUMENT FOR BOTH.
// Read it first: /api/bots/* is behind requireAuth and scoped to
// `req.account.accountID`, all a Pilot Hangar row has is that pilot's account
// NAME, and on a server whose login takes any password the name IS the
// credential. Sign in on a throwaway per-session token, act, sign out.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE IS WHO MAY USE IT. A stop is safe for any row: it
// never claims a hull. A START does claim one, so it must be used ONLY for a
// pilot that has no session in this tab. For a pilot signed in HERE the caller
// must be that pilot's OWN session instead, because /api/bots/start releases
// the CALLER's held bridge session as part of the start — a throwaway token
// holds nothing, so the hull would still be held by the tab and the host would
// refuse with "A web session is flying this character". PilotHangar.svelte is
// where that fork is made; this module is the arm that reaches another account.
//
// No character is ever selected on the throwaway session, so nothing undocks
// and no hull is claimed by it: the bot host mints its own session and selects
// the character itself.
