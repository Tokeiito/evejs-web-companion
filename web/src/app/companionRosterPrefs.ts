// THE FLEET COMPANIONS WINDOW'S OWN ROSTER — which pilots are in the op, which
// fleet the op is, and the limits they all fly under.
//
// ⚠ THE WINDOW USED TO HAVE NO ROSTER AT ALL, and that is what this replaces. It
// listed every pilot signed into the tab, automatically: a pilot you brought
// online to check a contract sat in the fleet roster alongside the three you
// meant, and there was no way to say which was which. A companion op is a set
// of pilots the player CHOSE, so the window now holds that choice.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NOT A HANGAR SQUAD, and the two must not be merged. A squad
// (app/hangarPrefs.ts) is a durable label on pilots ACROSS accounts, used to
// bring them online and to launch headless runs from the landing screen; its
// companion configs are per pilot because the pilots in a squad do different
// jobs. This is one live operation in one tab: one fleet, one set of limits,
// and a list that is emptied when the op ends. Storing it in the squad map
// would make "who is in tonight's fleet" a permanent property of a pilot.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS localStorage, SO IT IS NOT THE AUTHORITY FOR A RUNNING COMPANION.
// It is the template a start is built from. What a run is actually flying under
// is the request the loop was started with, which lives in the store.
