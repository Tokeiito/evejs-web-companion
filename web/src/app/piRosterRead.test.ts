// R108 slice 3: reading the PI roster's colonies — one throwaway sign-in per
// account, never a character select.
//
// What is checked, and why each matters:
//
//   1. NOTHING IS SELECTED. The read signs an account in on a token of its own,
//      asks the roster route, and signs out. The deps below have no way to
//      select a character at all, which is the point: a select claims a hull,
//      and a tab-run bot elsewhere would lose its ship without a word.
//
//   2. EVERY TOKEN IS SIGNED OUT, including when the read fails.
//
//   3. ONE ACCOUNT AT A TIME, the hangar refresh's reason: a dozen sign-ins at
//      once fill the browser's connection pool ahead of the player's clicks.
//
//   4. EACH PILOT GETS ITS OWN OUTCOME, so the board can word each one.
