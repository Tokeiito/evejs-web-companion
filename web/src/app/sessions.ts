// signals, so no two sessions share slice state) and its own flow in
// per-session-token mode (so it authenticates as itself and its background
// self-refresh can never ride another pilot's token — see AppFlowOptions
// `perSessionToken` and app/api.ts). This module owns only the *bundling*; which
// session is active and the list ordering are reactive concerns that live in
// App.svelte.
