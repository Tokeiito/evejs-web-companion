// Overview view logic (goal R11) — pure, framework-free, fully testable.
//
// The server hands the browser positions; everything a player actually reads in
// an overview — how far away a thing is, what order the list is in, what is
// filtered out — is computed HERE, in the client. That is not a shortcut: it is
// how the retail client works. The server pushes ball state and the client
// re-derives distance and re-renders on its own cadence.
//
// Nothing in this module renders a numeric game ID (goal R7d). It carries IDs so
// the caller can key rows, resolve names, and issue a move; the strings it
// produces (`formatDistance`) are units, never identifiers.

// `npcEntityType`, and why the whole of this client's threat logic reads them
// and nothing else.

// work. Structures and corp-owned balls also carry characterID 0, so a panel
// built on it flags harmless furniture as a threat — and a threat warning that
// cries wolf gets ignored, which is worse than not having one.
