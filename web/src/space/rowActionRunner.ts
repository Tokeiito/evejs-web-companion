// TURNING A VERB INTO A SERVER CALL (goal R77) — the single-call half.
//
// WHY THIS LEFT `Overview.svelte`. Until now the switch from a `RowAction` to a
// `flow` call lived inside the overview panel, which was fine while the verb bar
// was the only thing that could dispatch one. The radial menu makes that false:
// the same verbs are now reachable by right-clicking a bracket on the tactical
// view, which is a different component in a different subtree.
//
// ⚠ TWO COPIES OF THIS SWITCH WOULD BE THE WORST KIND OF DUPLICATION. They would
// not diverge loudly — they would diverge in ONE branch, so "Orbit" from the bar
// would hold the configured range and "Orbit" from the radial would hold the
// default, and nothing would look broken. Everything that dispatches a verb goes
// through here.
//
// ⚠ IT DOES NOT OWN BUSY STATE, ERRORS, OR CONFIRMATION. Those belong to the
// surface that dispatched — the overview disables per concern and lands each
// failure on its own control, and a different surface may want to report
// differently. This function calls and returns; it never swallows.
