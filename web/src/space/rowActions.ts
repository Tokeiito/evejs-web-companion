// What you can do to the thing you picked (goal R30 slice D) — pure,
// framework-free, fully testable.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every verb in the overview used to live in a `.row-actions`
// block rendered once per row: up to nine buttons times up to 200 rows,
// re-rendered every poll. That is where the operator's complaint actually bites
// — the grid was so wide with controls that the names and distances a player is
// reading got squeezed, and on a phone each row became a stack of nine
// full-width buttons you had to scroll past to reach the next row.
//
// So the row went back to being a row, and the verbs moved to ONE bar that acts
// on the thing you selected. The set of verbs is decided HERE rather than in
// markup, for the reason `space/overview.ts` and `space/gateLinks.ts` already
// established: a decision written as an `{#if}` in a template can only be
// checked by a regex over that template, and a regex over markup proves nothing
// about the decision. This returns DATA, so the claim "a station offers Dock and
// a rock does not" is a thing a test can read directly.
//
// Three rules it does not bend:
//   - Nothing here produces a numeric game ID for display (R7d).
//   - An action that cannot be used right now is still RETURNED, carrying the
//     sentence that says why (R9a). The bar renders it disabled with that
//     sentence on it. Dropping it silently would leave a player wondering where
//     a button went; leaving it enabled would promise something we cannot do.
//   - It is GENERIC by construction. There is no branch on "is this a rock" for
//     the flight verbs — a rock, a wreck, a station and another player's ship
//     all get Warp to / Approach / Orbit / Keep at range / Align to / Lock,
//     because the server treats them the same way and so should this.
