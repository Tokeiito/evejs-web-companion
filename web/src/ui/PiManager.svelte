  // PLANETARY INDUSTRY (R108 slices 3 to 5) — every assigned pilot's colonies
  // on one board, one action (restarting a pilot's ended extractors), what is
  // held across colonies, hangars and corp hangars, and the planner.
  //
  // ⚠ A GLOBAL WINDOW WITH NO STORE. Every other panel is a view of the mounted
  // pilot. This one is a view of the player's own PI roster, which spans
  // accounts, and it reads through its own throwaway sign-ins
  // (app/piRosterRead.ts) — so it takes no `store` and no `flow`, and a pilot
  // switch does not tear it down (globalWindow.ts).
  //
  // ⚠ NOTHING HERE SELECTS A CHARACTER. Reading a colony needs only ownership,
  // proved live; a select claims a hull, and a bot flying that pilot in another
  // tab would lose its ship without a word. Acting on a colony goes through the
  // SERVER bot host (app/piDispatch.ts), the one thing that arbitrates hulls
  // honestly: it refuses a pilot already flown, in its own words.
  //
  // ⚠ IT READS WHEN OPENED AND WHEN ASKED, AND NEVER ON A TIMER. The 30-second
  // tick below moves the ages on and touches no network. When to read on its
  // own is the scheduler's job, a later slice.
  //
  // ⚠ EVERY ROW SAYS HOW OLD IT IS. Pilots are read at different moments; the
  // board never presents them as one (bridge/piBoard.ts).
