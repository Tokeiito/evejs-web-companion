// The item-icon rules, shared by every panel that shows a thing (goal R27).
//
// This module is the pure half of `TypeIcon.svelte`: where an icon's picture
// comes from, and what stands in for it when there is no picture. It is
// deliberately dependency-free so the rules can be tested without a DOM.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ICONS ARE LOCAL ONLY.
//
// `scripts/cache-icons.js` downloaded a set of type icons into
// `data/icon-cache/`, and the BFF serves that directory at
// `config.iconCacheUrlPath` (`/icon-cache`) with `fallthrough: false` mounted
// ABOVE the SPA catch-all — so a type we never cached returns a real 404 and
// the `<img onerror>` fires, instead of quietly receiving `index.html` with a
// 200 and rendering a broken image.
//
// We link there and NOWHERE else. The browser never touches an external image
// host, so the client keeps working offline and leaks nothing about what the
// player is flying. `staticData.js` also exports `getRemoteTypeIconUrl`
// (images.evetech.net); it is NOT wired to the browser and must not be without
// an explicit, off-by-default opt-in.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FALLBACK IS THE COMMON CASE, NOT THE EDGE CASE.
//
// `data/` is gitignored. On a fresh clone, and in CI, `data/icon-cache` does
// not exist at all and EVERY icon 404s. Even on a machine that has it, the
// cache covers a few hundred types out of tens of thousands. So the named tile
// below is the design's default state and the picture is the bonus — not the
// other way around. Nothing in the UI may depend on an icon having loaded.
