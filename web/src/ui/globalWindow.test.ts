// The global window layer — the windows that outlive a pilot switch.
//
// What is worth pinning here is not the arithmetic but the rules that make a
// window "global" at all: that its position is NOT stored per character (the
// bug being fixed is the same window jumping around as you switch pilots), that
// a tab which is global can never also be a per-pilot desktop window (which
// would put a second, character-scoped copy of the roster on screen), and —
// since the fleet companion arrived beside the Bot Manager — that two global
// windows can be open AT ONCE rather than evicting each other.
//
// The desktop rule is enforced in desktop.ts and asserted from here, because it
// is this module's decision that desktop.ts is obeying.
