// R41 as it actually RENDERS: the colonies, and what is on a planet.
//
// Screenshots have been unavailable to every worker on this repo — and the
// browser pane never flushes async panel content — so the only honest way to
// say "this is on screen" is to render the component and read the output. That
// is what this file does, through Svelte's server generator.
//
// Four claims are load-bearing and each is checked against real markup:
//
//   1. THREE OUTCOMES, FOUR SENTENCES, NONE OF THEM ALIKE. "Still loading",
//      "that read failed", "you genuinely have no colonies", and "this server
//      reported no colony information" are distinct facts about the world, and
//      only the third is a claim about the player. This is the defect class
//      this codebase keeps reproducing (worldHasNoContracts, ownsNothing).
//
//   2. NO NUMERIC IDs REACH THE PLAYER (R7d). A planet is "Tanoo I", a
//      structure is its name. planetIDs, pinIDs and typeIDs live only in keys,
//      icon URLs and onclick arguments. The sweep at the bottom has a COMPANION
//      test proving its regex actually matches an id when one is present —
//      three sweeps in this repo were once written with a template-literal
//      `\b`, which is the BACKSPACE character and matches nothing.
//
//   3. TIME ON SCREEN COMES FROM THE SERVER. The countdown is the program's own
//      expiry against the server's clock, and a finished extractor says so
//      rather than showing a negative number. The browser clock these tests
//      render against is FROZEN, and frozen five hours wrong on purpose, so a
//      panel that read it directly would be caught rather than merely lucky.
//
//   4. THE ICONS ARE REAL PICTURES OR DELIBERATE TILES (R27). Every image on
//      the page comes from the local cache; TypeIcon's lettered fallback is the
//      only other thing allowed.
//
// The standing invariants are re-proven on the new markup: R7d, R9a (plain
// player language — no group names, no "pin", no "ECU"), R8 (touch-sized
// controls, a table that reflows).
