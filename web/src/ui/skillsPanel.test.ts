// R28 as it actually RENDERS: the character sheet, the queue, and the clock.
//
// Screenshots have been unavailable to every worker on this repo, so the only
// honest way to say "this is on screen" is to render the component and read the
// output. That is what this file does.
//
// Three claims are load-bearing and each is checked against real markup:
//
//   1. THE ICONS ACTUALLY APPEAR. R27 cached 466 skill icons — 100% of the
//      skill types — and this is the only panel in the app where the cache is
//      near-complete. A skill therefore renders an <img> pointing at the local
//      cache, not the lettered fallback tile.
//
//   2. A LEVEL IS NEVER A BARE DIGIT. Levels render as Roman numerals and as
//      five pips, and the pips distinguish OWNED from QUEUED — showing a
//      planned level as owned would tell a player they can fly something they
//      cannot.
//
//   3. TIME AND SP ON SCREEN COME FROM THE SERVER. The countdown is derived
//      from the entry's own end instant against the server's clock, and the
//      panel never renders a number the sheet did not carry.
//
// The standing invariants are re-proven on the new markup: R7d (no visible
// numeric IDs — a skill is its name, never a typeID), R9a (plain language),
// R8 (real, touch-sized controls).
