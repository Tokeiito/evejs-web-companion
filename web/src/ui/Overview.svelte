  // It was originally a component-local `$state` filled by an `$effect` that

  // effect could read all seven links back immediately afterwards) but the
  // template never saw it, on the same component instance. A synchronous write
  // in the same effect rendered fine; every asynchronous one was invisible.
  // Rather than keep guessing at the framework, the links now travel the exact
  // path the rest of this panel's data travels — the store, re-rendered every
  // second — which is the mechanism the whole app already depends on.

      Only holds this hull actually HAS appear: whether a ship has an ore hold,
      a gas hold, an ice hold or an asteroid hold is decided by whether the
      capacity attribute is populated, so a Venture and a Mammoth differ by DATA
      and nothing here special-cases either of them. What is not known reads as
      not known — an unknown fill is not an empty one.

      It stays fresh off the PUSH channel, not a poll: mining grants ore and
      emits OnItemsChanged, that frame reaches the browser, and the browser
      re-reads the hold from the ship. The notification is the trigger; the ship

    One bar, acting on one thing, replacing up to nine buttons on every one of
    up to 200 rows. What it offers is not decided here: `space/rowActions.ts`
    returns the verb list as data, and this renders it. That split is the whole
    point — a decision spelled out as {#if} blocks in markup can only be checked
    by a regex over markup, which proves nothing about the decision.

    It is `position: sticky` at desktop width so it stays reachable while you
    scroll a long grid. Sticky, NOT fixed: a sticky element still takes up its
    own space in the flow, so it cannot occlude the last row of the table the
    way a floating bar would — and that occlusion would be invisible at desktop
    width, which is where it would be shipped from. The fixed-bottom phone bar
    is a separate piece of work with its own body padding to compensate.

    R25 slice A — drones. Two lists, because they are two different things: what
    is sitting in the bay (launchable) and what is already flying (orderable).

    ⚠ LAUNCHING IS THE DEFENCE. The server auto-engages idle combat drones
    against whatever shoots your ship, so a miner who launches is defended
    without touching Engage at all. The note below says that plainly, because a
    player who does not know it will sit there clicking.

    The two limits are SHOWN and never enforced here: the server owns both, and
    a browser that pre-guessed them would either block a legal launch or promise
    an illegal one.

    R30 slice F — COLLAPSED, and moved below the grid. A hull with no drone bay
    still had two empty lists and a paragraph of explanation sitting between the
    player and the overview, on every single poll. The summary carries the count
    that matters — how many are OUT — so a collapsed panel never hides the fact
    that you have drones in space, which is the one thing you must not miss.

      R34 — WHAT THE SERVER ITSELF SAID, ONE LINE PER DRONE.

      ⚠ THESE ARE NOT OUR WORDS. `droneRuntime.js` refuses a drone order one
      drone at a time and writes a plain-language sentence for each — thirteen
      of them across engage, mine, salvage, scoop and recall. The BFF used to
      forward only the notifications, so every one of those sentences was
      thrown away and a refused order looked, to the player, exactly like a
      successful one. This is the recovered text, unedited.

      ⚠ AND IT IS A LIST FOR R30'S REASON. An order fans out over the whole
      flight and each drone answers separately; the two error paragraphs above
      are single slots, and R30 measured what a single slot does to a fan-out —
      with two Strip Miner Is, a later success cleared the slot and the earlier
      refusal vanished. One drone, one line, no merging, no deduplication.

      ⚠ NAMES ONLY (R7d). The server keys these by droneID; `flow.ts` spends
      that key on a name lookup and the report type has no id field at all, so
      there is nothing here for this markup to leak. A drone we cannot name
      reads "One of your drones" — never the number.

                A greyed "Bring home" with the explanation hidden in a tooltip
                is the silent decline again, one layer up: a player on a touch
                screen never sees a `title`, and a player who does see it has
                already pressed. This is the ninth confirmed silent decline on
                this server, and every one of them looked like a live button.
