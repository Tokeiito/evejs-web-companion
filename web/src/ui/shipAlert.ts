// The HUD's ship health alerts as the client's ShipAlertContainer runs them (eve/client/script/ui/inflight/shipAlert.py):
// the shield, armour and hull each alerting while below its threshold and taking damage, the capacitor while below its
// own and draining. What is shown of an alert is the red bars at the screen's top and bottom and the glow of the
// layer's gauge, with the layers above it (DoShieldAnimation, DoArmorAnimation, DoHullAnimation); the capacitor pulses
// (DoCapacitorAnimation). The warning label the container keeps is never shown (its opacity is 0 save for the capsule's
// animation), and the sounds are the client's alone.
