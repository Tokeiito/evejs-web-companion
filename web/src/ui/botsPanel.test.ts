// THE LAUNCHER as it actually RENDERS (goal R43).
//
// What this panel can get wrong is narrow and expensive:
//
//   1. LISTING A BOT AND NOT LAUNCHING IT. A launcher that renders but whose
//      Start does nothing is the failure mode of the whole goal, so the real
//      components must be EMBEDDED rather than described.
//   2. FORKING A READOUT. A second copy of "what the bot is doing" does not go
//      quiet when it drifts — it keeps rendering, confidently, about something
//      else. A static sweep pins that this file contains no such copy.
//   3. GOING SILENT ABOUT WHY. R30 and R33 both established that an unavailable
//      control states its reason. A checklist line that merely fails to tick
//      tells a player nothing they can act on.
//   4. The standing invariants — R7d (no visible numeric IDs), R9a (plain
//      player language), R8 (≥40px targets, no horizontal body scroll), R18
//      (renders against an empty store).
