  ⚠ `panel` IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION. `.panel-head`'s negative inline
  margin exists to bleed to the edges of a PADDED panel, and a windowed panel
  has no padding — so the stylesheet cancels the bleed with
  `.win-body > .panel > .panel-head`. Without `panel` on this section that rule
  does not match, the head hangs 16px outside on each side, and the window
  scrolls sideways (R8). Measured live at 5px, the moment this panel became
  reachable at all.
