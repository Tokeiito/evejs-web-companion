// The desktop window model's ONE-WINDOW-PER-TAB invariant, at the seam where it
// is easiest to lose: storage.
//
// The reducers all keep the invariant (openWindow focuses an open tab instead of
// adding a second). loadLayout is the one entry point that does not go through
// them — it parses whatever is in localStorage, which may have been written by
// any past build. A duplicate that survives that read reaches Desktop.svelte's
// keyed `{#each shown as win (win.id)}`, which throws instead of rendering; the
// throw aborts the render flush, and since the bad layout is saved straight back
// it happens again on every reload. That is a frozen page that survives a
// refresh, so this read must be the thing that cleans it.
