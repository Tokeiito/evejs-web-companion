  // THE BUILT-IN BOTS PANEL (goal R43).
  //
  // One place a player goes to say "run something the client already ships
  // with". It answers "what can I run?" and "is anything running?" for the
  // two built-in bots — mining and mission — with the same checklist and
  // running-status treatment either way.
  //
  // What USED to live here has moved to the Bot Manager: the saved-bot
  // library (any account's saved scripts, run here or handed to the server),
  // which pilot is flying what, and starting a bot on any held pilot rather
  // than only the one active in this tab. This panel could never reach those
  // other pilots; the Bot Manager can, so it owns that surface now.
  //
  // ⚠ IT EMBEDS THE REAL COMPONENTS AND FORKS NOTHING. `MiningBot.svelte` and
  // `MissionBot.svelte` are rendered here exactly as they are rendered where
  // they already live: same props, same controls, same readout. A second copy of
  // a readout drifts, and a drifted readout does not go quiet — it keeps
  // rendering, confidently, about a bot that is doing something else. Everything
  // this panel adds is ABOUT the bots (which exist, which is running, what each
  // needs) and nothing it adds is a re-statement of what one is DOING.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT IS A LAUNCHER, NOT AN EDITOR. Visual/node-based bot authoring is
  // under separate discovery; nothing here should pre-empt those decisions.
