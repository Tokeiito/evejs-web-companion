// NOTICES (goal R80) — the things worth interrupting a player for, and the log
// that keeps them.
//
// Plenty already HAPPENS in this client that a pilot would want to know about
// without staring at the panel it happened in: a pirate lands on the belt, the
// hold fills, a bot stops, the server refuses something. Until now each of those
// was reported only inside its own panel, so anything that happened in a window
// you had closed happened silently.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO SURFACES, ONE LIST
//
// A toast is the transient half and the log is the permanent half, and they are
// the SAME notices — a toast is simply a recent one that has not been dismissed.
// Keeping one list is what stops the log from missing something the toast
// showed, which is the failure that makes a notification log worthless.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⚠ WHAT A NOTICE MUST NEVER BE
//
//   • A poll result restated every second. Everything here is deduplicated by a
//     caller-supplied key within a window, because the sources are polling loops
//     — a hostile that is still on the grid a second later is not a new arrival,
//     and a toast stack that re-announced it would be unreadable within seconds.
//   • Colour alone. Every notice carries a `kind` AND a text `title`; the
//     styling is reinforcement.
//   • Unbounded. The log is capped, because a mining session runs for hours.
