  // BOT MANAGER — regions A, B and C (docs/bot-manager-brainstorm.md §4), plus
  // a GROUPS region above them.
  //
  // Groups (top): one row per pilot group — the built-in Companions group and
  // every squad the player made on the Pilot Hangar — each able to start one
  // bot on all of its free members at once. It sits ABOVE Pilots on purpose:
  // launching for a group is the coarse action and launching for one pilot is
  // the exception to it, and a player with six pilots arranged into two ops
  // should meet the two ops first. The membership is NOT this panel's to
  // invent — it is `app/hangarPrefs.ts`, the same squads the landing screen
  // shows — and every rule about who can be started lives in
  // `bots/pilotGroups.ts`.
  //
  // Region A (pilots, top): one row per held session in THIS browser tab, plus
  // one row per character with a live server bot and no held session here
  // (§4's "multibox wrinkle", option (a) — the roster is threaded in from
  // App.svelte as `sessions`, an optional prop so every existing caller and
  // the no-props SSR test keep working). All run-state logic — which mode a
  // pilot is in, its status words, its detail line — lives in
  // `bots/pilotRoster.ts`; this panel only fetches the server roster and hands
  // each pilot's inputs to `BotManagerPilotRow.svelte`.
  //
  // Region B (library, below): every saved bot, from every account, in one
  // list (Decision 1). "Saved by" names who wrote it for display only — it
  // confers no rights (Decision 5): any account here can load, edit or delete
  // any row.
  //
  // Both regions follow ServerBots.svelte's shape: poll-free (each list only
  // changes on an action taken here or elsewhere in the app), onMount load,
  // and error/empty/loading kept as three distinguishable states rather than
  // collapsed into one "nothing to show".
  //
  // THE LAYOUT IS PiManager.svelte's: a menu rail down the left, one view at a
  // time beside it, and a strip of four numbers over every view. The regions
  // used to be stacked, which put the library a long scroll under five groups
  // whose rows each repeated the same two explanations. Every view is still
  // RENDERED, only `hidden` — so a view's loading/error wording is decided the
  // same way whether or not it is the one on screen.

  // below it. This gives the window a strip of its own, in FleetCompanions.svelte's
  // shape, so the band directly under the title bar is honestly the window's.
  //
  // ⚠ TWO INDEPENDENT READS, ONE LINE, GATED ON BOTH. Region A/C's roster
  // (`serverBots`, fetched by `refreshPilots`) and region B's library
  // (`scripts`, fetched by `refresh`) are two unrelated calls, each still able
  // to be in flight or failed on its own schedule. Printing whatever answered
  // first would make the strip flicker between an honest partial and a
  // wrong-looking whole on every render, so it says nothing until BOTH have
  // settled — `pilotsLoaded` is set true in `refreshPilots`'s `finally`
  // regardless of outcome, and `view.kind === "loading"` is `libraryView`'s
  // own word for "the fetch has not answered yet" (see its doc). Nothing
  // rendered during loading is the CSS's cue too: a `.panel-head` holding
  // only the clipped `.panel-title` collapses its band rather than drawing an
  // empty strip (styles.css, the rule beside `.panel-title` itself).
  //
  // ⚠ A FAILED READ IS NEVER "0". `scripts.length` only appears once `view`
  // says the library actually loaded (`view.kind !== "error"`, `!== "loading"`);
  // `pilotsPart` reads `pilotsError` the same way region A's own rows do. Two
  // more places drawing that line, not a looser copy of it.
  //
  // `scripts.length`, not `filtered.length` — the strip is the LIBRARY's size,
  // and a search query narrowing `filtered` to zero rows must not read here as
  // "no bots saved" (that lie is exactly what the "no-matches" state below
  // exists to tell apart from "empty").

  // ⚠ NOW FOUR NUMBERS, SAME RULES. The strip became PiManager's summary `dl`,
  // one figure per fact, and each figure still waits on the read it comes
