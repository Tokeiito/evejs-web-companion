  // THE TACTICAL VIEWPORT (goal R70) — the picture of space the client has never
  // had. It sits behind the in-space shell's chrome and draws what the ship can
  // see: brackets on a tilted, range-compressed disc, labelled range rings, drop
  // lines for height, velocity vectors, and the one object you have picked.
  //
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // WHAT THIS FILE IS AND IS NOT
  //
  // It is a RENDERER. Every decision it draws — where a bracket goes, what
  // family it belongs to, which rings exist, what earns a label, what a click
  // landed on — is made in `space/tactical.ts` and pinned by its tests. This file
  // turns those answers into canvas calls and nothing else. That split is the
  // same one `space/overview.ts` and `space/rowActions.ts` already established,
  // and it is why "does a pirate draw red" is a question a test can read rather
  // than something you have to squint at a screenshot to check.
  //
  // ⚠ A CANVAS IS NOT AN ACCESSIBLE CONTROL, AND THIS ONE DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE.
  // Clicking a bracket is a convenience on top of a list that already works: the
  // overview's Select button is the keyboard path, it targets the same shared
  // selection, and the two stay in lockstep because there is only one. The canvas
  // carries a role and a summary label so a screen reader announces what is out
  // there rather than an unlabelled rectangle, and the summary is real text built
  // from the same rows the picture is drawn from.
  //
  // ⚠ THE DRAW IS WRAPPED. A `$effect` that throws wedges Svelte's scheduler and
  // the whole UI stops repainting while the bot loops keep running — a failure
  // this project has already diagnosed once and does not intend to repeat. So the
  // draw is guarded, and a failure is REPORTED (the error overlay picks it up)
  // rather than swallowed, then the viewport is left blank instead of taking the
  // cockpit down with it.

   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * ⚠ THIS IS WHERE "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered
   * notifications" CAME FROM, AND WHY IT IS WRITTEN THIS WAY.
   *
   * The first version did all of the work synchronously inside the observer
   * callback: it wrote `width`/`height` (reactive state, so Svelte re-rendered
   * and changed the canvas's inline style) and set `canvas.width/height`
   * directly. Both are layout-affecting writes to a child of the element being
   * observed, made while the browser was still delivering that element's
   * observations. The browser cannot settle that in one pass, so it drops the
   * remaining notifications and fires a global error — which flooded the error
   * overlay every time the dock panel was dragged.
   *
   * Three things fix it, and all three are load-bearing:
   *
   *   1. NOTHING IS WRITTEN FROM THE CALLBACK. The observation is stashed and
   *      applied in a `requestAnimationFrame`, i.e. after delivery is finished.
   *   2. A NO-OP RESIZE DOES NOTHING AT ALL. A drag fires this continuously with
   *      sub-pixel changes that round to the same integers; re-assigning
   *      `canvas.width` is never free (it clears the bitmap) and re-assigning
   *      the same reactive value would still schedule a frame.
   *   3. THE CANVAS NO LONGER SIZES ITSELF FROM STATE. It is stretched by CSS
   *      (`position: absolute; inset: 0`), so its display size is decided by the
   *      box rather than by a value this effect writes — which removes the
   *      feedback edge entirely instead of merely damping it.
