// The R36 mission-bot panel as it actually RENDERS.
//
// The panel is a pure reader, so what it can get wrong is narrow but expensive:
//
//   1. THE AGENT'S STATION. Jobs must be taken on in person, so the plan the
//      panel builds has to name the AGENT'S station — not whichever one the
//      player happens to be standing in when they press Start. Getting this
//      wrong sends the bot to ask for work from someone who is not there, and
//      it is invisible until the bot has flown somewhere pointless.
//   2. NOT BEING NARROWER THAN THE BOT. A station with no distribution agent is
//      the ordinary case (the live R36 run started at one). The ladder can fly
//      to a remote agent, so the picker must be able to offer one.
//   3. The standing invariants — R7d (no visible numeric IDs), R9a (plain player
//      language), R8 (data-label on every cell of a reflow table).
