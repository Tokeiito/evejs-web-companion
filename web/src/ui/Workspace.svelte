  //  • Serving any request whose number we had not seen replayed OLD ones. A

  //    earlier pilot, and opened that panel too — so opening the Bot Builder and
  //    then switching pilots opened it again on the pilot switched TO, and on
  //    every pilot after that.
  //
  //  • Seeding the mark from the counter AS IT STANDS AT MOUNT fixed that and
  //    broke the opposite case. "Set up this built-in on that pilot" switches
  //    pilots and asks for the panel in ONE tick, so by the time the new
  //    workspace mounts the counter already includes the request meant for it —
  //    which it then read as ancient history and ignored. The pilot switched and

  // drops it once served, which is what stops a later remount finding it again.
