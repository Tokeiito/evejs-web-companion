// The always-on chrome as it actually RENDERS (SSR).
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE WAS `shellRender.test.ts`, AND IT WAS TESTING DEAD CODE. It
// rendered `StationShell` and `SpaceShell`, two top-level layouts that the
// windowing workspace superseded and that nothing in the app imported — so a
// green run here proved something about components no player could reach, while
// the live chrome that replaced them (the HUD bar, the workspace header) had no
// render coverage at all.
//
// The shells are gone. The claims that still MATTER were re-pointed at the
// components that actually render them:
//
//   • "in space you can read your ship's condition, reach your modules, and get
//     to the flight panels"     → `HudBar`
//   • "the UI says where you are, in either state"  → `WorkspaceHeader`
//   • the Neocom, PanelHost and target-bracket tests were already about live
//     components and are unchanged.
//
// The one claim deliberately NOT replaced is the docked "station interior":
// there is no such surface any more. Docked, the dock panel and the Neocom are
// the station, and both are covered by `neocomRail.test.ts` and
// `panelFirstMount.test.ts`.
