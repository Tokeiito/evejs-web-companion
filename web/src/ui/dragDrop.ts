// DRAG AND DROP (goal R78) — what may be dragged, and what a target accepts.
//
// The fitting window and the hangars already had every action they need as
// BUTTONS: pick an item, then press Fit, or tick some rows and press Move to.
// Dragging is faster and it is what a player coming from the retail client
// reaches for first — but it is an accelerator on top of those buttons, never a
// replacement, and nothing here removes one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE RULES LIVE HERE
//
// A drop target that decides what it accepts inside a `dragover` handler can
// only be checked by dragging something onto it, which is not a thing a test can
// do. Worse, `dragover` runs on every mouse move over the target, so a rule
// written there is also the rule that decides whether the cursor shows "you may
// drop this" — get it wrong and the UI promises a drop it will then refuse.
// Deciding as DATA means the cursor and the drop agree by construction.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⚠ THE PAYLOAD TRAVELS AS TEXT, AND MUST SURVIVE A HOSTILE ONE
//
// `DataTransfer` carries strings, and a drag can start anywhere — another tab,
// another application, a file. `decodeDrag` therefore treats its input as
// untrusted: anything that is not our own well-formed payload decodes to null,
// and a null is simply "not something we accept". It never throws, because a
// throw inside a `drop` handler leaves the UI in mid-drag with no way out.
