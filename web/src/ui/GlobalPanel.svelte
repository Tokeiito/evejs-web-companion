  // from the Pilot Hangar as readily as over a cockpit, and take neither — each
  // reaches the pilots it acts on through their own sessions or their accounts
  // (app/pilotReach.ts, app/piRosterRead.ts). PanelHost still carries the same
  // three for a phone, where a global tab is an ordinary workspace panel.
  //
  // The Bot Builder is the one pilot panel drawn here, and only when it was
  // opened with nobody in the client (globalWindow.ts `PILOTLESS_BUILDER`);
  // HangarBotBuilder stands in for the pilot it would otherwise have.
