// THE GLOBAL WINDOW IS MOUNTED ABOVE THE PILOT-SWITCH REMOUNT — a source sweep.

// ⚠ WHY THIS IS A TEXT SWEEP AND NOT A RENDER TEST. The whole feature is a
// question about WHERE a component is mounted, and the failure is silent. App
// renders the active pilot's Workspace inside `{#key active.id}`, which
// destroys and rebuilds everything under it on every character switch. The Bot
// Manager works perfectly well from inside there — it just quietly loses its
// roster, its search box and its poll every time you switch, which is the exact
// behaviour the hoist removed and the exact behaviour nothing else would fail
// on. Moving the layer a few lines down, into the key, would pass every other
// test in this repo.
//
// A render test cannot see it either: `svelte/server` runs no effects and never
// switches a pilot, so both placements render identically. The placement itself
// is the thing to assert, so this reads the source and checks it.
