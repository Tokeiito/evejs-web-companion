  // THE PILOT HANGAR — the first screen of the app.
  //
  // What it replaced: one flat list of every character the tab had ever seen,
  // with a login panel under it. That works at three pilots. At fifty it is a
  // wall of identical rows with no structure at all — you scroll past four
  // accounts to find one hauler, and nothing on screen says which pilots belong
  // to the same operation.
  //
  // So this screen does three things the list could not:
  //   • GROUPS BY ACCOUNT. The one grouping the server actually knows about, and
  //     the one that matches how a multiboxer signs in.
  //   • ADDS SQUADS. A second, cross-account grouping the player makes — a
  //     mining op, a scout net — brought online in one click. Squads live only
  //     in this browser (app/hangarPrefs.ts); the server has no idea.
  //   • SHOWS ENOUGH TO CHOOSE. Wallet, skill points, where the pilot is and what
  //     it is training, without bringing it online first. All four come from the
  //     roster (app/knownCharacters.ts), refreshed on mount by a throwaway
  //     sign-in per account (app/rosterRefresh.ts).
  //
  // WHAT THIS FILE OWNS: the screen's own transient state — the search box, the
  // scope chip, the selection, which popover is open, manage mode, and the
  // launch queue. Persisted arrangement goes straight through to hangarPrefs;
  // every filter, sort, count and formatted string is computed in app/hangar.ts,
  // which is pure and tested. Nothing here fetches, and nothing here creates a
  // session: `onLaunch` hands that to App, which owns the multibox roster.
  //
  // "Bring online" means the web client opens that pilot's interface. Several
  // pilots are live in the one tab at once; the switcher between them is the
  // character bar, and is not this screen's business.
