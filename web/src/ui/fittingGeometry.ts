// The radial fitting layout's geometry (goal R21) — pure maths, no DOM.
//
// A real fitting window puts the SHIP in the middle and its slots on ARCS
// around it, so the eye learns one shape and reads any ship with it. This
// module turns "the server says this hull has N high slots" into "here is
// where each of those N sockets sits", and nothing else.
//
// Two rules make the layout readable across a fleet of different hulls:
//
//   1. A family's arc NEVER MOVES. High slots are always the top arc, mid
//      always the right, low always the left, rigs always the bottom. A
//      player who learns where their guns live keeps that muscle memory on
//      every hull, which is the entire point of a radial window over a table.
//   2. Sockets are spaced at a FIXED step until the arc runs out, then they
//      compress to fit. A 2-slot arc therefore looks like the first two
//      sockets of an 8-slot arc rather than two sockets flung to the horizon.
//
// The counts are the SERVER's. Nothing here knows or assumes 8/8/8 — a count
// of zero draws no arc at all, and a Rifter (4/3/3) and a Drake (8/6/5) both
// come out correct because the count is the only input.
