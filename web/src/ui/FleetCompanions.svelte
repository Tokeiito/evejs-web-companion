  // FLEET COMPANIONS — the global window, and the one place companions live.
  //
  // ⚠ WHY IT IS NOT A PANEL IN A PILOT'S DESKTOP. A companion takes its orders
  // from a fleet, and a fleet is a thing several of your pilots are in at once.
  // The questions this window exists to answer — who is following whom, who has
  // stopped, who is not in the fleet yet — are questions about the SQUAD, and a
  // per-pilot panel can only ever answer them one pilot at a time, by switching
  // to each pilot in turn and destroying the view you were reading. So it is
  // hoisted onto App's global layer (globalWindow.ts) and opened from the
  // character bar, which is the only chrome that outlives a pilot switch.
  //
  // ⚠ AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE BOT MANAGER, where it used to be. A companion is
  // not a bot: it has no script, no library row, no work it picks for itself,
  // nothing to export or share. It was built as the third instance of the
  // mining/mission bot pattern and inherited that furniture; `BotID` no longer
  // lists it (nav/botRegistry.ts) and neither does the Manager.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS A ROSTER YOU BUILD, NOT A MIRROR OF WHO IS SIGNED IN. It used to
  // list every session in the tab automatically: a pilot brought online to
  // check a contract sat in the fleet roster beside the three you meant, and
  // nothing on screen said which was which. An op is a set of pilots the player
  // CHOSE, so the window holds that choice (app/companionRosterPrefs.ts) and
  // adding a pilot is the act that puts it in the fleet and sets it flying.
  //
  // ⚠ THE JOIN IS THE `join-advertised-fleet` PROTOCOL, NOT A NEW ONE. You name
  // the op's fleet as it appears in the fleet finder; each added pilot then
  // applies, reads the SERVER'S OWN ANSWER, accepts the invite that answer says
  // was minted, and only then is in. An apply does not join you — see
  // docs/join-advertised-fleet-handoff.md, which is what an afternoon of a bot
  // hanging on a healthy fleet bought. The decider is nav/fleetJoinWatch.ts and
  // this file is only its driver: it performs what the decider asks for and
  // hands back what the server said.
  //
  // TWO KINDS OF ROW, both listed here because both are companions:
  //   • a TAB run — a pilot you added, flown by this tab's own loop, and
  //     stopped when the tab closes;
  //   • a SERVER run — started from the Pilot Hangar, flown headless by the BFF,
  //     and still flying when every tab is shut. Those are listed even though
  //     nobody added them: the Manager no longer shows companions, so without
  //     this a headless companion would have no door at all.
  //
  // ⚠ IT EMBEDS THE REAL PANEL AND FORKS NOTHING. The selected pilot's controls
  // and readout are `FleetCompanion.svelte` itself, bound to THAT pilot's store
  // and flow — the same component, the same Start/Pause/Stop, the same checklist
  // that has been live-proven. A second copy of a readout drifts, and a drifted
  // readout does not go quiet: it keeps rendering, confidently, about a
  // companion doing something else.

  ⚠ THREE FRAMES BECAME ONE, BECAUSE THE OP IS ONE THOUGHT. The fleet name, the
  roster and the control that adds to it used to sit in three stacked panels,
  each with its own border, accent hairline and bottom margin — and the caption
  under the fleet field read "Pilots added BELOW join this fleet", a sentence
  that has to reach ACROSS a panel border to say what it means. A frame is a
  boundary: drawing one between a field and the list it governs tells the player
  they are separate settings. They are not. Naming the fleet, listing who flies
  in it, and adding the next pilot are one task, so they are one panel, read top
  to bottom: what the op IS, who is IN it, how to add the next.

         one line that CHANGES: how many are flying.
         And it sits IN the strip, beside Stop all, rather than on its own line

  <h2>Limits for every pilot in this op</h2>
  <!-- ⚠ SET HERE, NOT ON EACH PILOT. Adding a pilot starts it, so there is no
       moment at which a per-pilot form would be filled in. A change here
       applies to the next companion that starts; one already flying keeps the
       numbers it was started with.

       ⚠ ONE COLUMN OF BOXES, NOT SIX. Each limit used to be its own flex row of
       label, box and unit, so six labels of six different lengths — "Flee
       below" against "Hold drones in the bay for at least" — put six boxes at
       six different places across the panel, with the unit trailing each at a
       seventh. There was no column for the eye to run down, and the numbers a
       player actually came to change were the hardest thing on the block to
       find. The grid gives the boxes one column and lets the labels END against
       it, which is also the only arrangement in which these read the way they
       are written: "Flee below | 30 | % of shield, armour or hull remaining" is
       one sentence with a control in the middle of it, not a label and a field.

       ⚠ AND THEY ARE IN TWO GROUPS, because they answer two questions. Four of
       them are about the ship getting hurt and two are about drones, and a flat
       list of six made the player read all six to find the one they wanted.

       ⚠ THE GROUPS ARE THE COLUMNS. Stacked, the block ran to nine lines of a
       window whose real subject — the roster and the pilot's readout — sits
       above and below it, so a form nobody touches between ops pushed the two
       things they watch during one apart. Side by side it is four lines, and
       the split costs nothing to explain because the reader already has it:
       there are two questions here, so there are two columns. They fold back
       into one when the window is too narrow to hold both without squeezing the
       units — `auto-fit` off a real minimum, so it is the CONTENT that decides,
       not a width somebody guessed.

       ⚠ AND THE UNITS WERE TRIMMED TO FIT, ONCE. A half-width column has about
       twelve characters' less room for the trailing phrase, and a unit that
       wraps to three lines gives back exactly what the second column won. What
       went is "remaining" (a floor is remaining health by definition) and
       "them" — and the drone shield fact, which was never a unit at all: it is
       a thing that happens when a drone comes home, so it is one note under the
       row rather than a tail on the label of it. -->

    THE REAL PANEL, BOUND TO THAT PILOT.

    ⚠ IT NAMES THE PILOT IN ITS OWN STRIP, AND THERE IS NO SECOND HEADING.
    This used to be preceded by a framed panel whose entire body was its own
    header: a border, an accent hairline and a divider drawn around a pilot's
    name and one button, sitting directly on top of the panel that actually
    reports on that pilot. Two frames, two headings and two rules for one
    subject — and the emptier of the two came first, so the heaviest chrome in
    the window was around the least in it. A panel's strip is where it names
    itself and where its controls live, so the pilot's name and Go to pilot go
    IN it, beside Pause and Stop.

    ⚠ `{#key}` IS LOAD-BEARING. `FleetCompanion.svelte` reads its store's slices
    once at init — it has to, because `$companion` needs a stable top-level
    binding — so handing a live instance a different `store` changes nothing: it
    would go on rendering the pilot it was created for, under another pilot's
    name. CharacterBar.svelte keys its one chip for exactly this reason.

     max-content`, rounded up. A track a rem under it looks like it fits and
     then folds every unit in both columns onto a second line — and a
     pair of columns that cannot is worse than one that can, because every unit
     in both of them wraps and the block comes out taller than it started.
     `auto-fit` with that minimum lays out two tracks when the panel can afford
     them and one when it cannot, so the question is asked of the real width
     every time rather than answered once with a guess.

     `min(28rem, 100%)` rather than a bare `28rem`: below the minimum a track
     would otherwise stay 28rem wide and push the panel sideways, which is the
     one thing R8 does not allow.

     ⚠ AND THE PAIR IS CAPPED, because `1fr` tracks divide ALL of a wide
     window between them. On a maximised one that put about 160px of nothing
     between the last unit of the left group and the heading of the right, and
     two blocks that far apart stop reading as a pair and start reading as two
     unrelated forms that happen to be level. The cap is a little over two
