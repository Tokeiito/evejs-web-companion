// ⚠ FOUND LIVE, AND IT HAD BEEN WRONG THE WHOLE TIME. `PanelHost` is one long
// `{#if tab === …}` chain whose last arm used to be a real panel: Chat. So a tab
// with no branch of its own did not error, did not blank, and did not warn — it
// opened Chat, inside a window whose title bar said whatever the tab was called.
// The notice log was in exactly that state: imported at the top of the file,
// rendered nowhere, and reachable from the Neocom by a button that showed a chat
// window titled "Log".
//
// That is a failure mode no render test catches, because every render test asks
// for the panel it already knows about. It is caught by counting instead: the
// tab list is the authority, and every id on it must appear in the chain.
