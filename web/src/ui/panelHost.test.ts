// `{#if tab === …}` chain, so a tab with no branch of its own did not error — it
// fell through to the last arm, inside a window whose title bar said whatever
// the tab was called. The notice log was in exactly that state: imported at the
// top of the file, rendered nowhere, and reachable from the Neocom by a button
// that opened the wrong thing in a window titled "Log".
//
// That is a failure mode no render test catches, because every render test asks
// for the panel it already knows about. It is caught by counting instead: the
// tab list is the authority, and every id on it must appear in the chain.
