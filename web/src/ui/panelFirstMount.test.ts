// Every panel must SURVIVE ITS FIRST MOUNT (goal R18).
//
// The bug this suite exists to prevent: the Fitting tab did nothing at all when
// clicked. `<Fitting>`'s template read `{activeShipName()}` — invoking a
// `$derived` STRING as if it were a function. That throws
// `TypeError: activeShipName(...) is not a function` while Svelte is creating
// the component, so Svelte abandoned the whole render, `page` never visibly
// changed, and the tab looked inert. Nothing reached `window.onerror`, so the
// failure was completely silent to the player.
//
// Nothing else in the suite could have caught it: `tsc` does not parse
// `.svelte` files (web/src/svelte-files.d.ts), and no test had ever executed a
// component. So this suite RENDERS them, using Svelte's server generator (no
// DOM needed — see svelteSsrHook.ts).
//
// Two layers, because they fail for different reasons:
//   1. render every panel against the store's INITIAL state, and the Fitting
//      panel against the RAW BFF read shapes decoded through the real flow —
//      this is the first-mount reproduction;
//   2. a static sweep asserting no `$derived` binding is ever invoked as a
//      function — this also covers template branches a render does not reach.
//
// `$effect` and `onMount` do not run under the server generator, so this pins
// RENDER-time correctness. It is the half where the R18 bug lived.
