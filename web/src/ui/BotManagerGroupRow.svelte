  // BOT MANAGER — one row for one GROUP of pilots.
  //
  // Sibling to BotManagerPilotRow.svelte, and deliberately its shape: the same
  // bot picker, the same two ways to start, the same runtime limit on the one
  // they apply to. A player who has started a bot on one pilot already knows
  // how to start one on six.
  //
  // ⚠ WHAT IT ADDS OVER SIX PILOT ROWS IS THE PART THAT CANNOT BE DONE SIX
  // TIMES. A group start asks for approval ONCE, fetches the script ONCE, and
  // works the pilots one at a time so a refusal on pilot three does not strand
  // pilots four to six (bots/startRun.ts, bots/groupStart.ts). Doing it by hand
  // in the pilot rows means six confirms, six fetches of a library that can
  // change between them, and no shared record of how it went.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT CAN REACH PILOTS NO TAB HERE HOLDS. The bot host mints its own
  // session and selects the character itself, so "Run on server" starts a pilot
  // that is not signed into this browser at all -- which is the whole point of
  // launching for a group. "Run here" cannot: a tab run flies a ship this tab
  // already controls, so it reaches only the members with a session open, and
  // says so rather than quietly doing less than it looks like.
  //
  // Every rule about WHO can be started lives in bots/pilotGroups.ts; this
  // component fetches, wires the flows, and renders.
