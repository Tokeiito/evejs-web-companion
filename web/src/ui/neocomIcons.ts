// THE NEOCOM'S GLYPHS (goal R74) — one icon per panel, as SVG path data.
//
// WHY ICONS AT ALL. The launcher rail was a column of text buttons, which is
// legible but costs ~11rem of permanent width and reads as a navigation menu.
// EVE's Neocom is a narrow strip of glyphs: it gives the desktop back its width,
// and — the part that actually matters in play — a shape is recognised faster
// than a word once it has been learnt, which is what a rail you hit hundreds of
// times a session needs.
//
// ⚠ AN ICON IS NEVER THE ONLY LABEL. Every button keeps the panel's real name as
// its accessible name and its tooltip, and the rail can be widened to show the
// names inline. A glyph is an accelerator for someone who already knows the app;
// it must never be the only way to find out what a button does.
//
// WHY HAND-AUTHORED RATHER THAN AN ICON PACK. A pack is a dependency, a build
// step and a licence for ~26 glyphs that each need to read at 20px against a
// dark panel. These are deliberately crude — two or three primitives each, all
// stroked, no fills — because at this size detail turns to mud, and because a
// set drawn to one rule looks like a set.
//
// Every path is authored in a 24x24 box and stroked by the component (round caps
// and joins), so a one-point "path" like `M12 12h.01` renders as a DOT. That
// trick is used for eyes, studs and indicator lights throughout.

import type { TabID } from "./tabs.ts";
