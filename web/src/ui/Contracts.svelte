  // Contracts page (goal R17, Slice B): the public delivery-job board, the

  //
  // A pure reader of the store's contracts slice. Every identifier is
  // translated to a name in bridge/contracts.ts or resolved through the shared
  // name cache before it reaches this file. Nothing here shows a contractID, a
  // stationID, a systemID or a characterID (R7d) — a contract is identified by
  // who issued it, where it runs from and to, and what it pays. ISK is
  // formatted from decimal strings by `formatIsk`, never JS numbers, because it
  // exceeds 2^53 in ordinary play.
  //
  // ⚠ THE BOARD IS EXPECTED TO BE EMPTY, AND THE PANEL SAYS SO. EveJS has no
  // NPC/seed contract generator, so nothing exists to find until a player
  // creates a contract. That is a fact about this world, not a failure, and it
  // is stated plainly — and only when the browse actually SUCCEEDED and
  // returned nothing, never when it failed.
  //
  // ⚠ "OFFERED TO YOU" IS A LIST THE OTHER THREE CANNOT HOLD. A contract
  // someone reserved for you is not on the public board (it is not public), not
  // in "waiting" (that is what YOU issued) and not in "taken on" (nobody has
  // taken it yet). It used to be counted in the summary line and shown nowhere,
  // which read as a broken page. Its own tab is the whole fix.
  //
  // The one WRITE here is taking a contract on. It moves ISK and items and
  // cannot be undone, so it asks first, on a screen that says what changes
  // hands, and the button is dead while the write is in flight.
