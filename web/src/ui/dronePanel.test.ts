// R25 as it actually RENDERS: the Drones section, and the threat block that
// makes a pirate impossible to miss.
//
// Two claims are load-bearing and both are checked against real rendered
// output rather than asserted in prose:
//
//   1. LAUNCHING IS THE DEFENCE. The server auto-engages idle combat drones
//      against whatever shoots the ship, so a miner who launches is defended
//      with no further clicks. A player who does not know that will sit there
//      clicking, so the panel has to SAY it.
//
//   2. "WE COULD NOT LOOK" IS NOT "NOTHING IS OUT THERE". A null drone list
//      must never render as an empty bay or an empty sky — that is what invites
//      a player to launch a second flight on top of the one already flying.
//
// The standing invariants are re-proven on the new markup: R7d (no visible
// numeric IDs), R9a (plain player language — "Pirate", never a runtime entity
// kind), R8 (real buttons).

// answer away. R34 stopped throwing it away, and these tests are about the
// difference between the two — which is not cosmetic:
//
//   R33's PREDICTION fires BEFORE a call, on a control the client can already
//   tell will fail. It is a button LABEL and its job is to stop a press that
//   would go nowhere. It covers exactly ONE of the thirteen cases.
//
//   R34's SENTENCE arrives AFTER a call the server actually refused. It is the
//   server's own words, per drone, and it covers all thirteen — including the
//   twelve no client could ever predict.
//
// They cannot contradict each other because they cannot both describe the same
// event: a control R33 disables is never pressed, so the server is never asked
// and there is no sentence to conflict with. The tests below pin that, and pin
// that where the server HAS spoken it is the server that is quoted.
