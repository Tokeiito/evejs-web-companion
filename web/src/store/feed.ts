// Feed adapter seam (goal R1b, roadmap section 5).
//
// The client-state store is fed by whatever event transport exists at the
// time: initially the legacy sequenced WS event stream
// (public/eventClient.js), transitioning to bridge-forwarded session
// notifications (roadmap section 9 / G6) as the legacy machinery retires. The
// store never sees the transport — an adapter normalizes whichever wire
// events it speaks into `FeedEvent`s and reports connectivity via `FeedSink`.
// Swapping the transport means swapping the adapter; the store, the UI
// readers, and (later) the autopilot loop are unchanged.
//
// R1b ships the interface plus an in-memory adapter (tests and the scaffold
// smoke page). The legacy-WS adapter and the bridge-notification adapter are
// R2+ work and implement this same interface.
