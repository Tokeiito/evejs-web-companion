// Client-state store skeleton (goal R1b, roadmap section 5).
//
// One store is the single source of truth mirroring the relevant EveJS
// session/character state in the browser. The UI pages and, later, the
// browser autopilot loop are *pure readers*: they read via `get()` or the
// per-slice signals and subscribe for changes; they never write slices
// directly. State enters through `apply(event)` — normally called by the
// feed adapter attached with `attachFeed` (see feed.ts), which hides whether
// the events came from the legacy WS stream or from bridge-forwarded session
// notifications.
//
// R1b ships the session/character skeleton. Further slices (inventory,
// journal, space, ...) arrive with their pages on the R2-R6 rail.
