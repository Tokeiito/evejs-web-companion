// What a RAT will do to you, read from the type's own dogma.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE NO NAME AND NO GROUP CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. The
// classifier next door (`targetPriority.ts`) reads the game's ship-GROUP name,
// and every group it knows — Interceptor, Force Recon Ship, Logistics — is a
// PLAYER hull. An NPC's group is "Asteroid Serpentis Frigate" or "Deadspace
// Angel Cartel Cruiser", so every rat on the grid falls through to "other" and
// a ratting bot's target priority is inert: nearest-first no matter what the
// player picked. This module is the other half of the answer.
//
// The case that settles it, verified in the pinned SDE (`typeDogma.jsonl`):
//
//   Pithi Arrogator        504 = 0      103 = 0       20 = 0
//   Dire Pithi Arrogator   504 = 0.25   103 = 20000   20 = -50
//
// Same faction, same size, same words in the name bar. One of them will hold
// the ship on the field and web it down to a crawl and the other one will not,
// and ONLY the attribute says which. A name match, a regex, a group lookup —
// none of them can tell these two apart, which is the whole reason the dogma is
// read instead of the label.
//
// The attributes, and why each one and not a neighbouring one:
//
//   504 entityWarpScrambleChance  — will it actually TRY. This is the gate.
//   103 warpScrambleRange         — the reach it tries at (20 km on the common
//                                   tackle frigates above).
//    20 speedFactor               — < 0 means it webs. Not a guess: the
//                                   server's own hostile-module definition
//                                   (HOSTILE_FAMILY_WEB in the emulator's
//                                   `hostileModuleRuntime.js`) uses speedFactor
//                                   as the web's strength attribute, so this is
//                                   the number the fight is actually run on.
//   932 entitySensorDampenDurationChance
//   931 energyNeutralizerEntityChance
//   935 entityTargetPaintDurationChance
//                                 — the three ewar chances a rat can carry.
//
// ⚠ THE CHANCE IS THE GATE, NOT THE RANGE AND NOT THE STRENGTH. `Pithum
// Silencer` carries warpScrambleRange 15000 and warpScrambleStrength 1 with
// entityWarpScrambleChance 0 — it has the numbers a scrambler would use and
// never uses them. Classifying it off the range instead of the chance makes a
// stand-off block flee from a rat that was never going to hold it, on a hull
// that is merely a normal thing to shoot. Read 504, and read it FIRST.
//
// Pure: attributes in, a verdict out. Nothing here knows about the store, a
// bot loop, or how the attributes were fetched.

 *    not be the same number, or a stand-off block computes a keep-at-range
 *    band off a rat that has no reach at all. Null when the type scrams but
 *    the range attribute is missing: it will hold you, at a distance nobody
