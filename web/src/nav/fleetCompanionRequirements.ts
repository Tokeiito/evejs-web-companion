// WHAT A FLEET COMPANION NEEDS BEFORE IT CAN START.
//
// ⚠ THIS USED TO LIVE IN nav/botRegistry.ts, AND MOVING IT IS THE POINT. The
// companion was built as the third instance of the mining/mission bot pattern,
// so it inherited that file, that catalogue and that library — and a fleet
// readout ended up inside a bot manager, where it never belonged. A companion
// is not a bot: it picks no work of its own, it has nothing to save or share,
// and it is set up and watched across every pilot at once rather than against
// one ship. `BotID` is the bot catalogue now, and the companion is not in it.
//
// WHAT IT STILL SHARES, and should: the requirement MACHINERY. The three-answer
// verdict (met / not-met / cannot-tell), the blocking-vs-advisory distinction,
// `evaluateRequirements` and the rule that a read which failed is not a read
// that said no are general, already tested, and would only rot if forked. So
// this module declares the companion's rows against that machinery and imports
// it from where it lives.
//
// ⚠ FRESHNESS IS STILL THE CALLER'S JOB. These are pure functions over injected
// reads: the window evaluates them against the store as a live advisory
// checklist, and `flow.ts` evaluates THE SAME objects against reads taken
// immediately before the first call. Only the second evaluation decides
// anything.
