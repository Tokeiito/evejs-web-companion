// The R36 distribution-mission bot, driven against SYNTHETIC state exactly as
// `autopilotLoop.test.ts` and `miningBotLoop.test.ts` drive their ladders: each
// case hands the decision one reading of the world and asserts which single
// atomic action comes back, at the right rung and in the right order.
//
// ⚠ THE CONVERSATION FIXTURES ARE REAL CAPTURED BYTES, NOT INVENTED SHAPES.
// `refusedCompleteResult()` below is the exact marshaled payload the live server
// returned in R35 when Complete was pressed at the wrong station — copied from
// the capture in `app/agentsFlow.test.ts` and decoded through the REAL
// `decodeConversation`. That practice is what caught the `null`-vs-`false`
// divergence in the first place, and a hand-written `{missionCompleted: false}`
// would have hidden it, because `!== false` passes on a false and fails on a
// null. See "the whole reason this file exists" test.
//
// Four things are asserted over and over, because they are what makes a bot
// safe to walk away from:
//
//   1. A 200 IS NOT PROOF. `doAgentAction` answers success on every branch, so
//      every rung is confirmed against the authority that owns the fact — and
//      each test can make that authority disagree with the call.
//   2. NO ACTION TOKEN IS EVER CACHED. The server re-mints them across a move,
//      so the loop must re-read and use THIS tick's id.
//   3. NO BRANCH REPEATS UNBOUNDEDLY. Every rung gets a world in which it can
//      never make progress, and every one must stop with a readable reason.
//   4. THE GATES RUN BEFORE ACCEPT, and unknown never passes them.
