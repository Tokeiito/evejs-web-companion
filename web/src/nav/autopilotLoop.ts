// Browser autopilot decide-loop (goal R5b, roadmap §7). A framework-agnostic
// port of the retail client's `autopilot.py` `AutoPilot.Update` tick loop: it
// SEQUENCES the R5a atomic calls (undock / warp / jump / dock) over a computed
// route, but never simulates or predicts position — each decision reads the
// authoritative `flight-status` and issues at most one atomic call, exactly as
// retail's client-side loop does.
//
// It runs in the BROWSER. Closing the tab is closing the client: the JS simply
// stops (no "stop" is sent), the ship completes whatever server-side command
// was last issued and then sits. The loop pauses (does not guess) on any
// unsafe/blocked condition, and after abort/pause it never calls the bridge.
//
// Truth model — MEASURE, don't guess (goal R13). Retail's autopilot measures
// `bp.GetSurfaceDist(ship, destination)` once per tick and picks the right call
// the first time. We now do the same: the R11 space snapshot reports every
// visible object's position and radius plus the ship's own, so the browser
// computes the identical surface distance and runs retail's threshold ladder,
// in retail's evaluation order:
//
//     < 2500 m   and the target is a gate     -> jump
//     < 50000 m  and the target is a station  -> dock
//     < 150000 m                              -> approach
//     otherwise                               -> warp
//
// Measurement is the PRIMARY path; the server's refusals remain as a backstop
// for the cycles where no snapshot is available (a slow read, a scene that has
// not caught up, a target the snapshot cannot see). When we cannot measure, the
// loop falls back to exactly the R5b mode-and-refusal behaviour it had before,
// including the verified approach-then-redock docking path. Either way, the
// browser only decides WHICH authoritative call to make — it never simulates or
// predicts position, and every move is still a server-side command.
//
// Three safety rules survive the rewrite unchanged:
//   - never act mid-warp (retail returns on DSTBALL_WARP);
//   - never re-issue a running approach (retail skips when already
//     DSTBALL_FOLLOW on that same target);
//   - pause rather than guess on an unexpected refusal.
//
// Retail's `ignoreTimerCycles` (settle a few ticks after a warp/jump so the
// transition starts before we re-decide) is mirrored by `settleTicks`.

//
//   * the sim refuses when `totalDistance < MIN_WARP_DISTANCE_METERS`
//     (warpState.js:236), where `totalDistance` is measured to the WARP-IN
//     POINT, not to the target's centre;
//   * that refusal comes back as `WARP_DISTANCE_TOO_CLOSE`
//     (warpCommands.js:250-255), and `_throwWarpFailureUserError`
//     (beyonceService.js:1693) only translates criminal / bubble / scramble /
//     immobile — everything else falls into `default: break` (:1713) and throws
//     NOTHING. The browser sees `ok:true, result:null` and a ship that has not
//     moved.
//
// So the loop re-measured, saw the same distance, decided "warp" again, and
// span. Two separate corrections, plus a bound, are needed — a decision that
// cannot make progress must pause with a reason, never repeat forever.
//
// CORRECTION 1 — stop paying the autopilot call's built-in 10 km.
// `Handle_CmdWarpToStuffAutopilot` (beyonceService.js:2983) hardcodes
// `minimumRange: 10000`, which is added to the warp's stop distance and so
// pushes the server's gate 10 km further out. Retail's own `WarpToItem` uses
// `warpRange=0`, and `Handle_CmdWarpToStuff("item", id, minRange=0)`
// (beyonceService.js:2654-2684) reaches the identical `warpToEntity` call with
// that 10 km removed. The loop now sends that shape (see AUTOPILOT_WARP_MIN_RANGE_M).
//
// CORRECTION 2 — measure against the gate the server actually applies. With the
// 10 km gone the two target kinds still differ:
//
//   station  `getWarpStopDistanceForTarget` (warpState.js:632) gives
//            `targetRadius + minRange + 2*shipRadius` against the station
//            CENTRE, so accepted iff `surfaceDist >= 150000 + minRange + shipRadius`.
//   stargate `resolveStargateWarpTarget` (runtime.js:2928) aims at a point on
//            the gate's near-side envelope, jittered by a RANDOM offset inside
//            `WARP_EXIT_VARIANCE_RADIUS_METERS` (runtime.js:701 = 2500), so
//            accepted iff `surfaceDist >= 150000 + minRange - shipRadius ± 2500`.
//
// The gate case is randomised, so no client can reproduce it exactly. What a
// client CAN do is never ask for a warp the server might refuse: take the
// worst case of both kinds. `max(shipRadius, 2500)` covers the station's
// `+shipRadius` and the gate's `+2500` at once.
//
// The residual band (150 km → the floor) is no longer a spin: the ladder falls
// through to APPROACH there, which is what retail does below minWarpDistance
// anyway and which actually closes the gap.
