// A4a — reading the world for a player script: tri-state conditions and which
// interrupt fires. Pure over an observation; the runner (slice B) builds the
// observation from fresh reads each tick and feeds it here.
//
// ⚠ CANNOT-TELL NEVER PASSES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every check is
// met / not-met / cannot-tell. A read that FAILED is not a read that said "no" —
// so an `until` that cannot be read does not advance the program, and an
// interrupt that cannot be read does not fire (nor is it quietly treated as
// "fine", which is how a dead-man switch rots). Two guards live here:
//
//   • THE ACUTE RULE (sealed, from the hand-written mining bot): a hostile is on
//     the grid AND ship health cannot be read → pause immediately. You do not
//     keep working blind next to a pirate. This only applies when no player
//     interrupt already handled the hostile — if the player chose "launch drones
//     on a pirate", that fires first and defends the ship.
//   • THE CHRONIC GUARD: when the safety floor's own read keeps coming back
//     unreadable, `resolveInterrupt` flags it (`safetyBlind`) so the runner can
//     count the streak and pause before the blindness becomes a habit.
