// GETTING ONE PILOT INTO THE FLEET YOU NAMED, AND WAITING AS LONG AS IT TAKES.
//
// The Fleet companions window is a roster you build: you name the op's fleet
// once, add pilots to it, and each added pilot has to get itself into that
// fleet before it can be flown by one. This module is the decider for that —
// pure, one pilot, one tick — and the window is the driver that performs what
// it asks for and feeds it back what the server said.
//
// ⚠ IT IS THE `join-advertised-fleet` BLOCK'S PROTOCOL, DELIBERATELY, AND IT IS
// NOT THAT BLOCK. The round trip is the one docs/join-advertised-fleet-handoff.md
// paid an afternoon to learn: an APPLY DOES NOT JOIN YOU. On an open advert the
// server mints an invite addressed to the applicant and notifies it; membership
// happens only when the client calls AcceptInvite. The first version of the
// block wrote the apply and waited for membership, and hung forever on a
// healthy fleet. So: apply -> read the server's own answer -> accept -> confirm.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS GENUINELY DIFFERENT FROM THE BLOCK, AND IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE.
// A block is one step of a script that has somewhere else to be, so an empty
// fleet finder is `done` there: nothing is advertised, carry on. This watch is
// the opposite promise — "add the pilot now, it joins when the fleet exists" —
// so an advert that is not there yet is a WAIT, not an answer, and the wait has
// no bound. The player ends it by removing the pilot.
//
// ⚠ AND IT NEVER STOPS A RUN. Every verdict here is about whether this pilot
// may JOIN; none of them reaches a companion that is already flying. A fleet
// whose advert is closed after the pilot is in it must not read as a problem —
// see the `appliedTo` arm of the in-fleet rung, which is there for exactly that.
