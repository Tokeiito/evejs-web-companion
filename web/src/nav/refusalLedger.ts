// What the server has been turning down, and how long it has been saying no.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A bot answered 227 consecutive NotEnoughCargoSpace refusals over TWELVE HOURS
// and reported "Taking what's inside." throughout. The refusals existed only in
// the BFF's log, because `scriptRunner.ts` caught every non-session error and
// dropped it with a comment — no counter, no store event, no status change, and
// the same settle window as a success, so it retried at full speed forever.
//
// Nothing here fixes a refusal. This is the thing that NOTICES one, and that
// turns out to be the whole difference between a bot that is wrong for a minute
// and a bot that is wrong overnight.
//
// ── WHY IT LIVES ON THE RUN, NOT ON THE STEP ────────────────────────────────
//
// Macros already count their own attempts (`MAX_BLOCK_ATTEMPTS`), and those
// counters do not hold: `scriptDecide.ts` drops a step's memory whenever the
// step is left, so a `forever` loop hands the same failing target a fresh
// budget on every lap. That is exactly why the log shows repeating bursts of
// five rather than one burst and then silence. A ledger owned by the RUNNER
// outlives the step, so its bound is the one that actually binds.
//
// ── THE RULE IT KEEPS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Wording goes through `describeRefusal`, which R31 makes the ONLY place a
// refusal becomes language. Nothing here writes a sentence of its own and
// nothing here shows a code to a player.

 * when its own scene/range check fails — so a can that merely drifted out of
 * range between the snapshot tick and the bind call is reported exactly like one
