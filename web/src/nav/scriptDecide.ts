// A4b — the tick orchestrator: given a script, a fresh observation, and the
// running memory, decide the ONE action this tick, and hand back the next
// memory. Pure and total — it always returns exactly one action (wait included)
// with a why, so bounds can dispatch on it and no tick is ever empty of a
// decision.
//
// ─── THE SHAPE OF A TICK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   1. If a "dock and stop" interrupt already fired, the ship is flying home;
//      keep flying it, then pause once docked.
//   2. Otherwise, interrupts first (A4a): a met one fires; a pirate with an
//      unreadable ship pauses.
//   2.7 A STOP NEVER HAPPENS IN SPACE. Every fault the runner cannot work
//      through — a blocked macro, the livelock guard, the step-tick cap, the
//      cannot-tell streak, an unknown macro, the sealed acute pause — and the
//      player's own "just stop" watch LATCH and fly the ship home first, then
//      pause docked with the reason that sent it there. A bot parked in a belt
//      is food: the rats keep coming and nobody is flying. `stopSafely` is the
//      only way any of them stops, and the only bare pauses left in this file
//      are the two at the END of that flight home (arrived, or it cannot be
//      flown), which must be terminal or the ship would latch forever.
//   3. Otherwise, the FORWARD SCAN runs the program: consult the active step's
//      macro, and if the step is finished (its `until` met while the macro is
//      armed, or the macro reports itself done) advance to the next node and
//      consult it IN THE SAME TICK — never backwards except a loop re-entering
//      its own body, counted against its repeat.
//
// ─── WHY IT CANNOT LIVELOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The scan records every position it visits this tick. Coming back to one it
// already tried means the program made a full loop emitting nothing — the exact
// "a tick can legally emit no world call" primitive the phases model died of.
// That is not silently tolerated: it pauses with a plain reason. A step that
// runs too long (a macro-internal counter gap) trips MAX_STEP_TICKS. A read that
// stays unreadable trips the cannot-tell streak. Every way of doing nothing has
// a bound.

 * per-tick response would lose its condition the moment it arrived and abandon
 * the ship in the station with the program stalled. Latching means the trip owns
 * the ship from the moment it fires until the ship is back out and working.
 *
 * THE STATION STAY IS THE REPAIR, and that is why there is no "wait for the
 * shields" rung: docking restores the shields and the capacitor by itself, so
 * what is left to do is the two layers that do NOT come back on their own —
 * armor and hull — which is precisely what the shop sells and what the
 * Repair-ship block already knows how to buy. The trip cap

/**
 * STOP — BUT NEVER IN SPACE. Every stop the player did not personally press goes
 * through here: it latches the reason and flies the ship home, and the pause
 * itself happens on arrival (`continueHeadingHome`), carrying that same reason
 * to the readout so the player still learns why.
 *
 * The reason this exists is a bot found paused in a belt with rats on top of it.
 * A stop in space is not a safe state — it is an unattended ship with its guns
 * off, and the longer nobody looks, the worse it gets. Docked is the only place
 * a bot may come to rest.
 *
 * It costs nothing when the ship is already safe: `scriptTravelHome` reports
 * "docked anywhere is done" on its first consultation, so the flight collapses
 * to the plain pause it would have been, on the same tick.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TWO PAUSES INSIDE `continueHeadingHome` MUST STAY BARE — arriving home,
 * and a home that cannot be flown to (no home station known). Routing those
 * through here would re-latch the ship into a flight it has just finished or
 * cannot make, and it would never stop at all.
