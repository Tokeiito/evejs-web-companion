// A4b — the tick orchestrator: given a script, a fresh observation, and the
// running memory, decide the ONE action this tick, and hand back the next
// memory. Pure and total — it always returns exactly one action (wait included)
// with a why, so bounds can dispatch on it and no tick is ever empty of a
// decision.
//
// ─── THE SHAPE OF A TICK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   1. If a "dock and stop" interrupt already fired, the ship is flying home;
//      keep flying it, then pause once docked.
//   2. Otherwise, interrupts first (A4a): a met one fires; a pirate with an
//      unreadable ship pauses.
//   3. Otherwise, the FORWARD SCAN runs the program: consult the active step's
//      macro, and if the step is finished (its `until` met while the macro is
//      armed, or the macro reports itself done) advance to the next node and
//      consult it IN THE SAME TICK — never backwards except a loop re-entering
//      its own body, counted against its repeat.
//
// ─── WHY IT CANNOT LIVELOCK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The scan records every position it visits this tick. Coming back to one it
// already tried means the program made a full loop emitting nothing — the exact
// "a tick can legally emit no world call" primitive the phases model died of.
// That is not silently tolerated: it pauses with a plain reason. A step that
// runs too long (a macro-internal counter gap) trips MAX_STEP_TICKS. A read that
// stays unreadable trips the cannot-tell streak. Every way of doing nothing has
// a bound.
