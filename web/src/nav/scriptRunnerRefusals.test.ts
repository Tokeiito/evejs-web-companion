// Refusals through the REAL runner and the REAL macros.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The runner commits a block's memory and board patch
// only when its world-call action SUCCEEDS (2fd4a77), so a block that sets an
// "I issued that" flag on the issuing tick and reads it back on the next one to
// react to a refusal never gets there: after a refusal its memory is unchanged.
// scriptMacros.test.ts drives macros one tick at a time and hands each tick the
// previous tick's nextMem, which is exactly what the runner does NOT do for a
// refused action — so those tests passed while two blocks were unreachable live.
// Everything here goes through `createScriptRunner` with `issue` throwing.
