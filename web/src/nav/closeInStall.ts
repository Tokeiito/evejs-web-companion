// The CLOSE-IN STALL rung — shared by every ladder that orders the hull to
// close on something and then waits for it to get there.
//
// ⚠ A CLOSE-IN ORDER THE SERVER ACCEPTS AND IGNORES LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ONE IT
// IS FLYING. `Handle_CmdFollowBall` and `Handle_CmdOrbit` both throw away what
// `spaceRuntime.followBall` / `orbitShipEntity` returned and answer 200/null
// either way, so the bridge reports `ok` for an order that moved nothing — and
// `keepAtRange` is the same server method as approach, so it is the same story
// again. The ONLY honest evidence this client has is the hull's own movement
// mode, the same reading the autopilot's close-in ladder already decides on
// (autopilotLoop.ts `decideCloseIn`). A block that says "flying to the wreck"
// or "closing on the wave" for the rest of the night while the mode says
// otherwise is telling the operator something it has not checked.
//
// ⚠ THE STALL THIS EXISTS FOR, because a re-issued order alone does not always
// break it. An order the server accepted and dropped leaves the hull in STOP or
// GOTO with the block still believing it is closing; sending the order again is
// the cheap and usually sufficient answer, and cutting the engines first is the
// answer when it is not. That much the ladder below does, and does honestly.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS FREE A PENDING LANDING, AND AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS
// NOTE CLAIMED OTHERWISE. eve.js marks a ship `landingPending` the moment a warp
// completes and retires it in a reconcile that wants the hull at STOP — but the
// same reconcile also wants the session to be ready for destiny, which is
// `initialStateSent` plus a live socket, and a session driven through the bridge
// does not reliably satisfy it. When the flag sticks, it sticks.
//
// And while it is set the pilot can issue NO movement at all. Checked command by
// command against the running server on 2026-09-14 — `gotoDirection`,
// `gotoPoint`, `alignTo`, `followBall`, `orbit`, `warpToEntity`, `warpToPoint`,
// `setSpeedFraction`, `stop` and `acceptDocking` every one of them opens by
// refusing on `hasPendingPilotWarpLanding`. The ungated variants that sit beside
// them (`stopShipEntity`, `followShipEntity`, `orbitShipEntity`) take an entity
// rather than a session and are reachable only from the server's own beacon,
// mining-NPC and fighter runtimes, never from a pilot command.
//
// So `CmdStop` is NOT the one order that gets through: `spaceRuntime.stop()`
// returns false on exactly the same test, and `Handle_CmdStop` answers 200/null
// regardless — the same accepted-and-ignored shape this file warns about above.
// It was watched failing: a stuck pilot was sent CmdStop four times in the three
// minutes before its warp home was refused, and again twenty minutes later, and
// never came free. There is no client-side cure, and this rung must not be read
// as one.
//
// That leaves the ladder worth keeping for what it genuinely does: it recovers a
// dropped order, and when nothing moves the hull it gives up QUICKLY and says
// the one true thing — this pilot's session has to be made again. What a caller
// does with that is its own call: a travelling block has nothing left and says
// so; a fighting block still has guns.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS WHY THE TEST IS ON MODES AND NOT ON DISTANCE. A hull under SOME
// target-relative order is closing on something, however slowly; STOP and GOTO
// are the two readings that prove nothing target-relative is running. The rung
// deliberately cannot tell "orbiting the WRONG rock" from "orbiting ours",
// because the ship's own row carries no `targetEntityID` on this server (see
// ui/shipHud.ts's note) — and a reading it cannot make is one it must not act
// on. Distance was the other candidate and is worse: a slow hull far out is
// indistinguishable from a stopped one for minutes at a time.
