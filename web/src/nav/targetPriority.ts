// Which hostile to shoot FIRST. A fight is decided by what dies in what order:
// the frigate holding you down is worth more dead than the battleship you could
// simply have warped away from. Every combat block until now shot whatever was
// NEAREST, which is the one ordering that ignores the question entirely.
//
// ⚠ HULL CLASS IS A PROXY, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE THERE IS. Nothing in a grid
// read says what a ship has FITTED — a snapshot row carries position, health,
// owner and type, never modules — and no read tells this client "that one is
// pointing me". So a class here is the job the HULL was built for, read from
// the game's own group name: an Interceptor is tackle because that is what
// interceptors are for, not because this one was seen holding anybody. A
// battleship with a scrambler on it reads "other" and a Logistics hull with no
// reps fitted still reads "logi". Said plainly so nobody reads more into a
// class than it carries — this is a better opening guess than distance, not
// knowledge of the enemy fit.
//
// The group name is resolved through /api/names (`typeGroup`), the same
// resolve-then-judge pass nav/droneRoles.ts makes: the game says what a hull IS
// and this file only reads the answer. Matched EXACTLY (trimmed, lowercased)
// against the SDE's own ship-group names — verified against the local SDE
// (`groups.jsonl`, categoryID 6, the build src/config.js pins):
//
//   tackle  831 "Interceptor", 541 "Interdictor", 894 "Heavy Interdiction Cruiser"
//   ewar    893 "Electronic Attack Ship", 833 "Force Recon Ship", 906 "Combat Recon Ship"
//   logi    832 "Logistics", 1527 "Logistics Frigate", 1538 "Force Auxiliary"
//
// EXACT, never a loose /recon/i or /logi/i, for the same reason droneRoles.ts
// anchors its patterns: "Prototype Exploration Ship" and "Industrial Command
// Ship" are neither of those things, and a substring match against a localised
// name is how a hauler ends up primaried.
//
// ⚠ THE GROUP LIST ABOVE IS PLAYER HULLS, AND A RAT IS NOT ONE. Every NPC in
// the static data is an "Asteroid Serpentis Frigate" or a "Deadspace Angel
// Cartel Cruiser", so against rats the group classifier answers "other" for the
// whole grid and the player's ordering does nothing at all — nearest-first,
// wearing a priority list. That is what `targetClassForThreat` below is for: a
// rat's OWN dogma says what it does, and `nav/ratThreat.ts` reads it. The dogma
// is asked first and the group answers only when the dogma said nothing, so
// player hulls keep exactly the classification they had.

 *
 * ⚠ TAG OUTRANKS EVERYTHING, DELIBERATELY. Class priority is this client's own
 * guess at what matters most on a grid it cannot see modules on (see the
 * file-header note). A tag is not a guess — it is the fleet commander looking
 * at the fight and saying "this one, now". When the two disagree the human
 * wins, so tag is compared FIRST.
 *
 * ⚠ A LIVE JAM SOURCE IS NOT A GUESS EITHER, SO IT OUTRANKS THE CLASS. A
 * typeID in `threat` is a statement about what a hull of that type CAN do; an
 * itemID in `jammingSources` is the server's own `OnJamStart` push naming THIS
 * specific rat as holding THIS specific ship right now. Ground truth beats the
 * static read, including for a type whose dogma this client read wrong or
 * never fetched — so a jamming row is promoted above every row it is not
 * already ahead of on tag, class or dogma alike. It still loses to the FC's
 * tag, for the same reason class does: the human is looking at the fight.
 *
 * The class itself comes from the rat's dogma FIRST (`targetClassForThreat`)
 * and falls back to the group name (`targetClassForGroup`) when the dogma said
 * nothing — the NPC half and the player half of the same ladder, in the one
 * order that lets each answer the rows it can actually see.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS STILL A RANKING, NOT A FILTER. None of the four comparisons ever
 * removes a row: a class the player left off ranks last, a rat nobody could
 * classify ranks with "other", and an unmeasurable distance sorts last inside
 * its group. The worst thing that happens to any row here is being shot second.
 *
 * Every new parameter is optional and defaults to "nothing is known", which
 * collapses the ordering back to exactly the old (class, distance) behaviour —
 * `tagOf` to "nothing is tagged", `threat` to "no dogma was read" (so the group
 * classifier decides alone, as it did), `jammingSources` to "nothing is holding
 * us". Every existing caller keeps its current result unchanged.
 *
 * A row whose distance is unreadable sorts last WITHIN its tag-and-class
 * group rather than being dropped: an unmeasurable ship is still a ship, and
 * dropping it would hand the fight to whatever the measurement happened to
 * miss. Ties keep the order the caller passed, so a nearest-first list stays
 * nearest-first.
