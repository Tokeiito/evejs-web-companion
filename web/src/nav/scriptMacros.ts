 * where `inWarp` is true. The three blocks that warp somewhere and then have to
 * know they got there all used to watch for exactly that state, and from the day
 * that guard landed (2026-09-11) none of them ever saw it again: each issued its
 * warp, sat out the flight unasked, resumed on the far side having witnessed
 * nothing, counted out its patience and reported that the warp had never started
 * — while the ship sat on the destination grid taking fire, because the step
 * never finished and the block after it never ran.
 *
 * So arrival is read from `obs.completedWarps`, a count the OBSERVATION keeps
 * because the observation is the only layer read on every tick. The step records
 * it when it issues; a higher count afterwards is a warp that finished.
 *
 * `sawWarp` is still honoured first, and is not dead code: it is what a macro
 * sees if it is ever driven WITHOUT that guard (every pure test does exactly
 * that), and it costs one flag to keep both paths true.
 *
 * ⚠ AN UNREADABLE COUNT IS NOT AN ARRIVAL. Null on either side answers false and

// is gone pick the next — warping to the step's belt (a pinned one, or else
// the nearest) first if no rock is in range. The player's `until` (ore hold
// full) is what ends the block.
//
// Two things layer on top of that core loop:
//   • NEAREST-mode rotation (decision 2, docs/bot-builder-brainstorm.md §op-2):
//     a belt found dry after arrival is not a stop, it is a cue to rotate to
//     the nearest belt not yet reported dry — pausing only once every belt has
//     been visited and found empty. That "found dry" memory is SHARED across
//     every pilot running a mining bot: it lives on the BFF, in-process, keyed
//     by solar system NAME then belt NAME (never a grid-local id, which means
//     nothing to a pilot in a different instance of the same system), and it
//     expires on its own so a later tour finds rock that respawned. This block
//     only reads it (`obs.dryBelts`) and reports into it (the `rememberBeltDry`
//     action) — it holds none of that state itself. A CHOSEN (pinned) belt
//     never rotates: it keeps the original "pause when dry" behaviour, pinned
//     to the one belt.
//   • VALUE PRIORITY, when the player wrote NO ore list: the block works the
//     richest ore on the grid first — the rocks whose `oreValuePerM3` is the
//     highest one present — and only falls through to the next ore once those
//     are gone. A hand-written list is left exactly as written, because a player
//     who typed one is saying "I need THIS ore", which is a different question
//     from "what is this belt worth". Nothing is priced → no restriction, which
//     is the behaviour this block always had.
//
//     ⚠ IT RESTRICTS, IT DOES NOT ROTATE. The candidate set only ever shrinks
//     within the rocks already on this grid, so "the belt is dry" still means
//     what it always meant — no rocks at all — and a bot cannot start touring
//     belts because the Veldspar here is not the Kernite it saw somewhere else.
//     The rock currently being WORKED also stays a candidate: a richer rock
//     drifting into view must not make a half-mined one get dropped.
//   • ORE PRIORITY (the step's optional `ores` tier list): only rocks whose
//     groupID matches the CURRENT tier's family are mineable. A belt with none
//     of that ore counts as dry for the tier exactly like an all-out belt does
//     for the plain case; once every belt is dry for the tier, the next tier
//     starts a fresh tour. The current tier is per-pilot (kept on this pilot's
//     own run board, `mineOreTier`) — two pilots working the same system can be
//     on different tiers. Tiers run out → blocked. Deliberately NOT handled: a
//     higher-priority family reappearing on a belt already dry for a lower
//     tier (e.g. Veldspar respawning while working Kernite) is simply not
//     noticed — the tour already moved on, and chasing respawns mid-tier is
//     not worth the extra state for how rarely a rock resource turnover
//     matters here.

// ⚠ THE LIST IT IS HANDED HOLDS ONLY MODULES THAT CYCLE, and that is the
// caller's work, not this block's (flow.ts `resolveDefenseModuleIDs`, which
// drops anything with no dogma cycle). What arrives here is therefore hardeners
// and the damage controls that really do burst — never the ordinary damage
// control, which is already working the moment it is online. Every message
// below is worded for that: a ship can carry a damage control and still have
// nothing this block can switch.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING TO HARDEN WITH IS `skipped`, NOT `blocked`. It used to STOP THE
// BOT, and that was the wrong shape of answer twice over. A hardener is
// something a hull HAS or has not: no amount of waiting, retrying or player
// attention turns a bare rack into a full one, so there is nothing a stop could
// achieve. And hardening is done ON THE WAY to the work — a mining trip, a den
// — never the work itself, so a ship without one still has everything under
// this block to get on with. Exactly the salvager-on-a-ratting-hull case two
// thousand lines up, and it takes the same answer: the orchestrator says so
// ONCE (through the alert path, so a player who was away still sees it) and
// moves on, silently on every later lap.
//
// ⚠ AN UNREADABLE FIT FALLS DOWN THIS SAME BRANCH, and skipping is right for it
// too. `resolveDefenseModuleIDs` hands back empty lists when the fit could not
// be read, which is indistinguishable here from a bare rack — and a bot that

// fights until a watch pulls it home, repairs PERFECTLY, comes back to the same
// den, and does it again until somebody notices. `MAX_RECOVER_TRIPS` cannot see
// it — `releaseRecoverTrips` drops the whole tally the moment the watched
// condition reads not-met, so a repair that WORKS resets the cap, and every one
// of these repairs works. The ship is fine every time. The site is the problem.
//
// The arithmetic all lives in nav/siteProgress.ts and none of it is repeated
// here: this file only FEEDS it (what the fight block saw this tick) and OBEYS
// it (leave, and stop touring the label). Two blocks talk to it — `fight-the-
// rats` writes the verdict, `warp-to-anomaly` acts on it — and they talk over
// the RUN BOARD, which is the channel they already share for `anomsVisited`.
//
// ⚠ NONE OF IT MAY LIVE IN STEP MEMORY. Step memory is wiped every time a step
// is left, so a per-visit budget hands every failing site a fresh allowance on
// every lap; this codebase has already paid for that lesson once (the note above
// `MacroMemory`: 227 consecutive refusals in bursts of five). "This site has been
// beating me" is the same shape as "this object has been refusing me" and belongs
// in the same place.

/**
 * ⚠ IS `fight-the-rats` ACTUALLY APPLYING DAMAGE RIGHT NOW? — the one input
 * nav/siteProgress.ts refuses to compute for itself, and the single thing in
 * this parcel most likely to be got wrong.
 *
 * The dangerous version of this feature blames the SITE for faults at OUR end:
 * drones sitting in the bay, drones ordered on nothing, a lock that never
 * landed, a rat parked outside the drone leash, guns chattering with an empty
 * bay. Every one of those reads as "nothing is dying" and NOT ONE of them means
 * the den is unwinnable — the honest answer to each is to fix the fit or the
 * position. A stall counter that ticked through them would throw away good
 * anomalies AND hide the real bug behind a plausible verdict, because a pilot
 * told "this den is too hard" never goes looking for the drones that were 40 km
 * out doing nothing.
 *
 * So every rung below is a rung this block can positively SEE, and every one of
 * them must hold:
 *
 *   1. There is a primary we have been holding (step memory's `targetID`) and it
 *      is STILL on the reachable grid — `hostiles` is already gated by the
 *      hull's targeting range where that reads, so a row that survives it is a
 *      row the ship can lock. A target that died or drifted out leaves here.
 *   2. This block's own COMBAT drones are out. `roleOut` and not `out`: a flight
 *      of salvage drones is not damage.
 *   3. They were ordered onto THIS primary (`dronesOn`), not onto the last one.
 *      The tick that issues `engageDrones` therefore does NOT count — it has
 *      ordered damage, not applied any — and nor does the tick after a target
 *      switch, which clears `dronesOn` on its way past.
 *   4. The primary is LOCKED. Waiting on a lock is our problem and not the
 *      site's, and §13 names it explicitly.
 *   5. The primary is inside the DRONE leash, which is a different and usually
 *      shorter leash than the lock range in rung 1 (see nav/kiteBand.ts, which
 *      records what substituting one for the other cost). `fight-the-rats` has
 *      NO range control at all — it never repositions — so a rat that lands at
 *      the far edge of lock range simply sits there out of reach of the drones,
 *      which is exactly the "no damage that is our own fault" case.
 *
 * ⚠ AN UNREADABLE DRONE LEASH FALLS BACK TO THE 20 km NO-SKILLS BASE, NOT TO
 * INFINITY. Control range is skill-derived and rides a fitting read a bot run
 * does not force, so null is the COMMON case and reading it as "no limit" would
 * count every long-range tick as damage going in. Guessing LOW is the cheap half
 * of being wrong here in the same way it is in `kiteBand`: an assumed-short leash
 * only ever refuses to count ticks, so the stall fires late or not at all, which
 * costs the player minutes. Guessing high costs them the anomaly AND the
 * diagnosis. When in doubt, false.
 *
 * Guns are deliberately not a rung of their own: a gun boat with no drones
 * reports `false` on every tick and never accrues a stall. That is the
 * conservative reading and it is on purpose — this block cannot see a turret's
 * optimal, its falloff, its tracking or whether the charge bay is empty, so the
 * only honest thing it could say about a gun is "I pressed the button".

// deliberately refused to own from where it sits:
//
//   1. THE PLAYER'S ARGUMENTS, read off the step.

 * player typed, because that is the number their overview shows them; `kiteBand`
 * and every leash in `droneBoatLadder` are metres. Hand 25 straight through and
 * the band resolves a 25-METRE hold — the ship flies into the middle of the rats
 * — and hand 25000 to a box bounded 1..300 and the codec clamps it to 300 km,
 * which parks the boat outside its own drone leash where nothing dies and the

//
// ⚠ THE GATE IS THREE-STATE AND CLIENT-SIDE, AND THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL. The
// server's own gate (fleetRuntime.js) checks commander-ness and returns a bare
// `false` for a non-commander, but its only caller throws that boolean away —
// the HTTP ack this block would see is identical whether the tag landed or was
// silently dropped (see bridge/fleetCommand.ts's header, in full). `obs.canTag`
// is populated from the SAME bound-fleet read this pilot's own row lives in, so
// this decider never re-derives commander-ness itself — it only reacts to the
// three answers: null (cannot tell — wait), false (not a commander — skip and
// keep fighting), true (go ahead).
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS HONESTLY IS: a SINGLE-LETTER, SINGLE-PILOT capability, not smart
// fleet-wide tagging. Nothing in a snapshot or a roster read says whether the
// FC, or another companion running this SAME block on another hull, already
// lettered a ship — there is no such list to read. The only thing stopping a
// re-tag is THIS block's own memory of what IT last wrote (`taggedTargetID`
// below). Two pilots running this block in the same fleet would fight each
// other's tags every time their own picks disagree. It is safe only when
// exactly one pilot in the squad runs it — say so if this ever grows a

// -- join-advertised-fleet ----------------------------------------------------
// The fleet-finder twin of join-fleet. join-fleet waits to be INVITED and stops
// the run if nobody ever invites it; this one goes looking, by name, in the
// advert listing -- and is OPPORTUNISTIC where the other is a requirement:
//
//   * already in a fleet  -> done, immediately. "if not in fleet" is the block.
//   * no fleet by that name advertised -> done, immediately, NOT blocked. This is
//     the point of the block. It is meant to sit at the top of a loop an alt runs
//     all day: the moment the boss advertises "Mining Op" the alt joins it, and
//     every other lap it finds nothing, finishes, and carries on mining alone. A
//     block that stopped the run here would make that loop unusable.
//   * advertised -> apply, ACCEPT the invite that produces, then confirm.
//
// That last line is the whole round trip and all three steps are ours. An apply
// does NOT join you: the server mints a fleet invite addressed to this pilot and
// notifies it, and membership happens only when the client accepts. This block
// is the client. The first version stopped after applying and waited for
// membership to arrive on its own, and hung forever on a perfectly healthy
// fleet -- fixed 2026-09-09.
//
// An approval-gated advert is the other half: it stores a request only the boss
// can act on, so there is no invite to accept and no amount of waiting helps.
// The block says so and stops, rather than timing out and blaming the fleet.
//
// The BOUNDED wait is not the same judgement as the absent-fleet one. A join
// that was applied for AND accepted and still did not land is a real failure the
// player wants told about, and silence there is the silently-refused-forever
// trap this file keeps guarding against. So: absent fleet finishes quietly, a
// join that will not complete stops with a reason.
//

// an unattended ship must not end up in a stranger's fleet because their name
// happened to contain the player's word. Where two adverts share a name the
