// EVERY BOT THIS CLIENT CAN RUN, declared once (goal R43).
//
// Two things live here and they exist for the same reason: both used to be
// hand-written per bot, at each call site, and both were already wrong.
//
// ── 1. WHO HOLDS THE SHIP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Mutual exclusion between the browser decide-loops was two lines in flow.ts
// and they were asymmetric — `startMissionBot` stopped the mining bot, and
// `startMiningBot` stopped only the travel autopilot, never the mission bot. So
// starting the mining bot on a ship the mission bot was flying left BOTH loops
// ticking, each issuing movement and module calls against one ship, neither
// able to see the other.
//
// A third hand-written line would have fixed that instance and left the shape
// intact: a fourth bot needs three more lines and gets one of them wrong. So
// exclusion is structural instead. `BotID` is the one union, `createShipClaim`
// takes an EXHAUSTIVE `Record<BotID, () => void>` of stoppers, and claiming the
// ship for one bot walks every OTHER registered bot and stops it. Adding a bot
// means adding it to the union — at which point the compiler refuses to build
// until its stopper exists, and it inherits exclusion from every other bot
// without anyone remembering to write anything.
//
// ── 2. WHAT A BOT NEEDS BEFORE IT CAN START ────────────────────────────────
//
// Each bot DECLARES its requirements as pure functions over injected reads.
// Nothing here fetches; everything here is a plain node --test case. Three
// rules make the difference between a checklist and a guess:
//
//   • THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. met / not-met / cannot-tell. A read that failed
//     is not a read that said no.
//   • CANNOT-TELL DOES NOT PASS. If we could not check it, the bot does not
//     start and says which check it could not make. This is the same
//     pause-rather-than-guess rule both loops already follow; letting unknown
//     fall through to "fine" is how a bot starts against a ship nobody looked
//     at.
//   • EVERY VERDICT CARRIES A SENTENCE. The words live in bridge/refusals.ts
//     with every other "this will not happen" sentence in the app, so the R9a
//     sweep that pins them reaches these too.
//
// ⚠ FRESHNESS IS THE CALLER'S JOB, and it is the whole point. These functions
// are pure over whatever reads they are handed — so the PANEL evaluates them
// against the store, as a live advisory checklist, and `flow.ts` evaluates the
// SAME requirement objects against reads taken immediately before the first
// call. A stale "you have a mining module" is exactly the failure this is
// meant to prevent, and only the second evaluation is authoritative.
