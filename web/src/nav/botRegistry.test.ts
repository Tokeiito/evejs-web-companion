// WHAT A BOT NEEDS BEFORE IT WILL START (goal R43).
//
// Every case here is pure: the requirements are functions over injected reads,
// so nothing in this file needs a server, a session or a clock. That is the
// whole reason they were built that way.
//
// The three properties worth the file:
//
//   1. CANNOT-TELL DOES NOT PASS. A failed read is not a read that said yes.
//   2. A MINING MODULE IS A HIGH-SLOT MODULE. Pinned against Farmer's real
//      Procurer, whose two Strip Miner Is sit at flags 27 and 28 and whose two
//      decoys — an Ice Harvester Upgrade (LOW slot) and an Ice Harvester
//      Accelerator (RIG) — are unreachable from a high-slot filter.
//   3. BLOCKING vs ADVISORY is the difference between a launcher and a
//      launcher that is narrower than the bot it launches.
