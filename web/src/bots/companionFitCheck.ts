// Fleet companion — reading the ship it is actually in, and saying what is
// missing before it flies.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: A SQUAD HAS NOBODY TO ASK. Every module list on a
// `FleetCompanionRequest` is an `itemID` of one particular fitted module on one
// particular hull, picked by an operator looking at that ship in the fitting
// panel. A squad start has no such operator -- the pilots are not mounted,
// nobody can see their fits, and a list saved earlier would be stale the moment
// that pilot refits or swaps hull. So a squad stores settings (`CompanionSetup`),
// and the bot host, which HAS signed the pilot in and CAN read the fit, fills
// the lists in here. Nothing about a fit is ever saved.
//
// ⚠ THE WARNINGS ARE ADVISORY AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. The operator's own words:
// warn, and let a human either load the missing thing or ignore it and fly.
// Nothing in this module refuses a start. A blocking check here would ground a
// squad over one empty ammo bay.
//
// ⚠ EVERY CHECK FAILS SILENT RATHER THAN LOUD. A fit that cannot be read
// produces NO warnings, not a warning about everything: this module only ever
// speaks when it is confident, because a readout that cries wolf on an
// unreadable fit teaches an operator to ignore it -- and the one time it is
// right is the time they will ignore it too.
//
// PURE. No store, no I/O. The caller hands it plain data read elsewhere -- this
// module cannot itself resolve a drone's typeID to a group name, which is why
// the role split below arrives already computed.
