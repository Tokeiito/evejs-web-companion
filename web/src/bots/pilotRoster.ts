// The Bot Manager's "pilots" region PURE VIEW LAYER — one row per pilot,
// showing what each is running. No component, no fetch, no clock of its own,
// exactly as bots/libraryView.ts (its sibling in the same slice).
//
// A pilot can be running a bot two structurally different ways, and this
// module's whole job is to tell them apart honestly rather than collapse
// them into one "running" flag:
//
//   • IN THIS TAB — `store.bots.runningBotID` (a `ShipControllerID`) plus
//     `store.customBot` for a player-built script. Dies when the tab closes.
//   • ON THE SERVER — a `ServerBot` from `listServerBots()`. Keeps flying
//     with the tab shut (src/botHost.js).
//
// ⚠ A SERVER BOT ALWAYS WINS OVER A TAB READING FOR THE SAME CHARACTER.
// botHost's claim model means starting a bot on the server releases any tab
// session flying that same character first (see Bots.svelte's
// `startSavedOnServer`, which calls `flow.releaseSession()` right after the
// server accepts the start). So if a tab reading AND a server bot both name
// one character, the tab reading is simply stale — it has not caught up with
// its own release yet — and the server bot is the truth. `pilotRunState`
// encodes this by taking the server bot as an explicit, checked-first input
// rather than leaving callers to reconcile the two themselves.
