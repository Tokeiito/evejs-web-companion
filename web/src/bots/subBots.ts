// Expanding "run one of my saved bots here" nodes — the composition step.
//
// ⚠ EXPANSION HAPPENS ONCE, BEFORE THE RUN STARTS. The runner never sees a
// sub-bot node: by the time it starts, every included bot's steps are spliced in
// as ordinary program nodes. That is deliberate — the forward scan, the livelock
// proof and the step caps all keep reasoning about ONE flat program, and none of
// them needed a single change to support composition.
//
// Two things make the splice safe:
//
//   • NO CYCLES. A bot may never include itself, directly or through a chain
//     (A → B → A). The walk carries stable resolved identities on the stack
//     and refuses a repeat, so expansion always terminates. `MAX_SUBBOT_DEPTH`
//     is the second, blunter bound.
//   • NO ID COLLISIONS. Two copies of the same bot would carry the same step
//     ids, and ids are how per-step memory and the readout are keyed — so every
//     inlined node is re-idded under the including node's id.
//
// It is PURE: the caller resolves exact ids / unique names and hands documents
// in, so this module is testable with a plain map and does no I/O.
