// nothing." No component, no fetch of its own, no clock — exactly the house
// style set by libraryView.ts and pilotRoster.ts: a pure core, unit-tested
// without a DOM, with a thin caller supplying the real fetch/confirm/starters.
//
// Both callers go through the SAME two steps for the SAME reason: decode the
// stored doc (decode-on-read — a saved bot is executable authority, and every
// byte reaching a runner passes the codec, never the caller's own trust of
// what it once wrote), then get the player's explicit approval before
// anything starts. Skipping either step here would silently re-introduce the
// fork this module exists to prevent.
