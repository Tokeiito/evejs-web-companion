// The Bot Builder document — the shape a player-authored bot is SAVED, IMPORTED
// and EXPORTED in, plus the pure structural helpers that read it.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE IS THE FORMAT AND NOTHING ELSE. It holds no player-facing strings
// (those live in scriptText.ts, one R9a register), issues no calls, and decides
// nothing (the runner's decide function does that). It is the single source of
// truth for what a valid document can CONTAIN — the codec validates against these
// types and these bounds, the editor builds them, the runner reads them.
//
// ─── WHY THE SHAPE IS WHAT IT IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The design (docs/bot-builder-brainstorm.md) settled a Human-Resource-Machine
// program: an ordered list of INTERRUPTS checked every tick, above an ordered
// list of STEPS run top to bottom. Two safety properties are STRUCTURAL here —
// unrepresentable rather than validated — so no import can strip them:
//
//   • A CYCLE IS UNDRAWABLE. Order is an array index and a step has no outgoing
//     edge, so the only backward edge in the whole format is a loop block
//     re-entering its own body, counted against `repeat`. There is nowhere to
//     express "jump to step 2".
//   • TWO CALLS IN ONE TICK IS UNREPRESENTABLE. A step names exactly one macro;
//     a macro decides exactly one action. The format cannot ask for two.
//
// And the pieces the operator's decisions pinned (see the doc's "Operator
// decisions"): a loop repeats a bounded count OR forever (decision 1); a belt is
// a runtime "nearest" binding or a chosen one (decision 2); decision 3 (a
// non-deletable, auto-injected safety-floor watch) was REVERSED on 2026-07-23 —
// watches are entirely the player's now, and the codec no longer injects one
// (docs/bot-builder-progress.md:148); a hostile interrupt lets the player pick
// drones-or-run (decision 5).

/**
 * What a fired interrupt does.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTHING HERE EVER COMES TO REST IN SPACE. A stopped bot is an unattended
 * ship with its guns off, and a mining bot that stopped in a belt is food, so
 * every stop happens FROM A STATION: the runner flies home first and pauses on
 * arrival, carrying the reason with it (nav/scriptDecide `stopSafely`). The same
 * rule covers the runner's own faults — a blocked block, the livelock guard, the
 * step-tick cap — which are not responses at all and so are not listed here.
 *
 *   • "pause"          — stop and say why, from a station. In space that means
 *                        flying home first, which reads the same as
 *                        "dock-and-pause"; docked, it stops on the spot.
 *   • "dock-and-pause" — break off, dock at home, pause (the safety-floor
 *                        response, and the hostile "run for the station" pick).
 *   • "dock-and-repair"— break off, dock at home, PATCH THE SHIP UP, and then
 *                        CARRY ON from where the program left off. The one
 *                        response that flies the ship home without ending the
 *                        run: it is "go and lick your wounds", not "stop".
 *
 *                        The stay is the repair. Docking restores the shields
 *                        and the capacitor, and the station's repair shop fixes
 *                        the two layers that do NOT come back on their own
 *                        (armor and hull) — the same shop, through the same
 *                        block, that a Repair-ship step uses. Then it undocks
 *                        (only if the watch fired out in space; a watch that
 *                        fired in station leaves it docked) and the program
 *                        resumes at the very step it was interrupted on.
 *
 *                        ⚠ IT IS TRIP-CAPPED. A response that goes home and
 *                        comes back is a loop, and a loop whose condition the
 *                        trip never fixes is a bot flying laps: after a few
 *                        round trips with the watched reading still bad, it
 *                        stops from the station like any other watch instead of
 *                        commuting forever (nav/scriptDecide `MAX_RECOVER_TRIPS`).
 *   • "launch-drones"  — put drones out and KEEP WORKING (the hostile "use
 *                        drones" pick). Bounded by the existing three-attempt
 *                        launch rule, which heads home if it cannot.
 *   • "fight-back"     — TANK UP AND ACTUALLY FIGHT the pirate, then keep
 *                        working. Every fitted hardener that HAS a cycle goes
 *                        on first (an ordinary damage control has none — it is
 *                        already working, and is never reached for) — one tick
 *                        each, the instant self-targeted
 *                        move a player makes before they touch the guns — and
 *                        then the fight: drones out, lock the nearest hostile
 *                        inside targeting range, drones onto it, every idle gun
 *                        onto it — the same ladder the Fight-the-rats block
 *                        runs, borrowed rather than copied. It is what
 *                        "launch-drones" is usually mistaken for: launching
 *                        drones tells them to defend, it does not point them at
 *                        anything.
 *
 *                        When the pirate is gone the watch STANDS THE SHIP DOWN
 *                        — the drones it committed come home, then the hardeners
 *                        it switched on go back off, so the next lap starts cold
 *                        instead of burning capacitor on an empty grid. It undoes
 *                        only its OWN work: a hardener the player's Hardeners-on
 *                        block lit is never claimed and never switched off.
 *
 *                        ⚠ IT MUST NEVER OWN THE SHIP FOREVER. An interrupt
 *                        that keeps returning an action starves the step under
 *                        it, so the ladder hands control back the moment there
 *                        is nothing left to fight — grid clear, nothing inside
 *                        targeting range, or no way to fight at all — and the
 *                        program carries on from where it was. The stand-down is
 *                        bounded the same way: one action per rung, never a wait.
 */
/**
 *   • "repair"         — switch the matching repairers ON while the condition
 *                        holds and the capacitor allows, and back OFF when it
 *                        clears — the "keep the ship repaired" watch. The step
 *                        keeps working; repairs ride the watching layer.
 *   • "alert"          — TELL THE PLAYER and keep working: a notification, a
 *                        sound, and a line in the bot's readout. It changes
 *                        nothing about the ship, so it is the one response that
 *                        is safe to put above a real one.
 *
 * ⚠ TWO PROPERTIES MAKE "alert" BEHAVE, and both live in the orchestrator
 * (nav/scriptDecide), not here:
 *   • IT FIRES ONCE PER EPISODE. A condition that stays met would otherwise
 *     alert every tick — thirty notifications a minute, which is how an alert
 *     trains a player to ignore it. The row is marked spent on the first alert
 *     and un-spent only when its condition reads not-met again.
 *   • A SPENT ALERT ROW IS TRANSPARENT. Interrupts are first-match-wins, so an
 *     alert row sitting above a dock-and-pause row would silence it forever.
 *     Once spent, the scan skips the row and carries on down the ladder — so
 *     "tell me, AND dock" is two rows that both work.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THAT TRANSPARENCY IS NOT THE ALERT ROW'S PRIVILEGE — it is the rule for
 * ANY row that fires and then turns out to have no work this tick: a repair
 * watch for a layer with no repairer fitted (or whose repairers are all already
 * running), a launch-drones watch whose drones are out, a fight-back watch with
 * nothing in reach to shoot. Such a row hands the tick on DOWN THE LADDER rather
 * than to the program, so the rows under it still fire (nav/scriptDecide
 * `fallThrough`). Without that, the most ordinary safety layout a player writes
 * —
 *
 *     shield-below 0.10 -> repair          (on an armour boat: no shield booster)
 *     armor-below  0.45 -> dock-and-pause
 *
 * — is a flee rule that never fires, because the row above it wins every tick
 * and does nothing with the win. A row only holds the ship while it is acting
 * on it.
