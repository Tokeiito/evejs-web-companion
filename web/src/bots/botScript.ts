// The Bot Builder document — the shape a player-authored bot is SAVED, IMPORTED
// and EXPORTED in, plus the pure structural helpers that read it.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE IS THE FORMAT AND NOTHING ELSE. It holds no player-facing strings
// (those live in scriptText.ts, one R9a register), issues no calls, and decides
// nothing (the runner's decide function does that). It is the single source of
// truth for what a valid document can CONTAIN — the codec validates against these
// types and these bounds, the editor builds them, the runner reads them.
//
// ─── WHY THE SHAPE IS WHAT IT IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The design (docs/bot-builder-brainstorm.md) settled a Human-Resource-Machine
// program: an ordered list of INTERRUPTS checked every tick, above an ordered
// list of STEPS run top to bottom. Two safety properties are STRUCTURAL here —
// unrepresentable rather than validated — so no import can strip them:
//
//   • A CYCLE IS UNDRAWABLE. Order is an array index and a step has no outgoing
//     edge, so the only backward edge in the whole format is a loop block
//     re-entering its own body, counted against `repeat`. There is nowhere to
//     express "jump to step 2".
//   • TWO CALLS IN ONE TICK IS UNREPRESENTABLE. A step names exactly one macro;
//     a macro decides exactly one action. The format cannot ask for two.
//
// And the pieces the operator's decisions pinned (see the doc's "Operator
// decisions"): a loop repeats a bounded count OR forever (decision 1); a belt is
// a runtime "nearest" binding or a chosen one (decision 2); decision 3 (a
// non-deletable, auto-injected safety-floor watch) was REVERSED on 2026-07-23 —
// watches are entirely the player's now, and the codec no longer injects one
// (docs/bot-builder-progress.md:148); a hostile interrupt lets the player pick
// drones-or-run (decision 5).

 *                        launch rule, which heads home if it cannot.

 *                        drones onto it, every idle gun onto it — the same

 *     trains a player to ignore it. The row is marked spent on the first alert

 *   • A SPENT ALERT ROW IS TRANSPARENT. Interrupts are first-match-wins, so an
 *     alert row sitting above a dock-and-pause row would silence it forever.
