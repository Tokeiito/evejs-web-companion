// Starting ONE thing on EVERY pilot of a group, one pilot at a time.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS `squadStart.ts`'S CORE, LIFTED OUT SO A SECOND CALLER CANNOT FORK
// IT. The companion squad start on the Pilot Hangar had the only copy of two
// rules that are not about companions at all -- start sequentially, and never
// let one refusal strand the rest -- and the Bot Manager's group launcher needs
// exactly those rules for a SAVED BOT. Copying them would have left two
// implementations of "what happens when pilot three is already flying", which
// is precisely the drift this codebase extracts to avoid (see startRun.ts's own
// header for the same argument about the approval path).
//
// PURE ORCHESTRATION. No fetch, no store, no component, no clock. The caller
// passes in who to start and how to start one; this decides the order, what
// happens when one refuses, and what the player is told.

 * ⚠ SEQUENTIAL, AND NOT BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLER. `App.svelte`'s `bringOnline`
 * already argues this for signing pilots in and the argument carries: a browser
 * allows about six connections per origin, so six simultaneous starts fill that
 * pool with starts and the seventh request of any kind queues behind them. Each
 * pilot also LANDS separately this way, which is what makes a progress readout
 * honest -- a row flips because that pilot is actually flying, not because a
 * timer fired.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE REFUSAL MUST NOT STRAND THE REST OF A GROUP. A pilot already flown by a
 * bot, or by a tab, refuses with CHARACTER_IN_USE / BOT_ALREADY_RUNNING; that
 * is a fact about that pilot, not about the operation. It is recorded and the
 * next pilot is tried.
 *
 * `startOne` rejects with whatever the server said; this module turns that into
 * a sentence and carries on. It never throws.
