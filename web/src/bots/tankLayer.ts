// Which layer a hull is BUILT to be hit in, read off the group names of what it
// is carrying.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS: A BUFFER FIT CYCLES NOTHING, SO IT SAYS NOTHING. Every
// other answer the companion has about a ship's tank comes from a list of
// modules it can switch on -- `shieldBoosterModuleIDs`, `armorRepairerModuleIDs`
// -- and those lists are the strongest possible statement, which is why
// `tankHealth` (nav/fleetCompanionLoop.ts) asks them first and only reaches this
// module when they are all empty. A brick makes no such statement: plates,
// coatings, membranes, extenders and rigs are PASSIVE, so they can never appear
// in a list of things to activate, and before this a plated hull with no
// repairer fell back to the worst-layer fold -- which means fleeing over a
// shield that was never its tank.
//
// ⚠ SO THIS IS THE ONE CLASSIFIER IN THE COMPANION THAT WANTS PASSIVE MODULES,
// and that inverts the rule its neighbours follow (`resolveDefenseModuleIDs`
// drops anything without a dogma-73 cycle, because a passive module in an
// activation list is a call wasted every tick). Nothing here is ever activated.
// It is evidence about intent, and on a brick ALL of the evidence is passive.
//
// PURE, and over GROUP NAMES rather than type ids — the same resolve-then-judge
// shape `splitDroneRoles` (nav/droneRoles.ts) uses, for the same reason: asking
// the game what a type IS belongs to the caller, and deciding what the answer
// MEANS belongs here, where it can be tested without a store.

 *     one — the guard is here because the names read alike and the cost of being
