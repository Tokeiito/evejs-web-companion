// label for a value, DERIVED from the format (`botScript.ts`, `macroSpecs.ts`)
// rather than hand-maintained here. That is the whole point: the previous
// `BotBuilder.svelte` hand-wrote an `{#if step.macro === "..."}` chain for
// arguments and two separate hardcoded condition-kind arrays, so three arg
// kinds (`equipment`, `corporation`, `agent`) had NO widget, `request-mission`
// had no editor branch at all, and `wallet-below` / `wallet-above` /
// `cargo-full` were legal `until` conditions the editor could never offer.
// Every export below closes one of those gaps STRUCTURALLY: a `Record<K, …>`
// over a closed union fails to COMPILE when a new value of `K` appears, the
// same guarantee `MACRO_CATALOG` (`macroCatalogView.ts`) already gives macros.
//
// Pure UI metadata. No id ever reaches a label (R7d); every string here is
// plain language, no engineering jargon, no raw token (R9a).
