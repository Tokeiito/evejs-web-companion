// The fleet companion's launch authority and codec — the companion-shaped
// mirror of runPolicy.ts, for the reasons docs/fleet-companion-plan.md,
// "4. The headless launch grant" (DECIDED), lays out:
//
//   • `validateBotLaunchGrant` (runPolicy.ts:183) is UNCHANGED. It reads only
//     `policy.riskClasses`, so any object shaped like a `BotRunPolicy` passes
//     through it — a script's or a companion's. Keeping the two producers
//     separate and the validator singular means a companion's grant is
//     re-derived and re-checked by the exact code path a script's is, instead
//     of a second, drifting copy of that logic.
//   • A companion has no macros and no program tree, so `macroIDs` and
//     `restartBlockers` are always empty and `containsSubBots` is always
//     false — there is nothing here for either to describe.
//
// ─── Risk derivation, decided ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "fleet" is UNCONDITIONAL. `decideCompanionAction`'s first rung
// (fleetCompanionLoop.ts:280) yields the ship to a fleet warp on every tick,
// server-authoritative and never opted out of, and decision 5 lets the
// companion leave and rejoin a fleet on its own initiative. Both are "fleet"
// risk on their own; the setup has no field that could turn either off.
//
// ⚠ THE TAGGING TOGGLE THIS SECTION USED TO ARGUE ABOUT IS GONE ENTIRELY, NOT
// JUST FAILING TO GATE ANYTHING. `attemptsTagging` no longer exists — tagging
// is unconditional now, gated only by the server's own tag-rank check
// (docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md, "Tagging"). There is no flag left
// for a reader to wonder whether it switches "fleet" off, because there is no
// flag; the question this paragraph used to answer no longer has anywhere to
// be asked.
//
// "social" is UNCONDITIONAL too, and this is the one class whose justification
// is FORWARD-LOOKING rather than already-exercised. Phase 8 gives the companion
// a fleet-chat surface (the command parser, the sender gate, and the
// acknowledgement a heard order needs), and nothing on `CompanionSetup` gates
// whether it may speak — every real channel is always on
// (docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md, "What it listens to").
//
// ⚠ THAT IS DELIBERATE, NOT PREMATURE. A grant describes the authority a run is
// given, not what it has already done, and the alternative is worse in a way
// pilotRoster.ts:229 spells out: it renders an empty list as the sentence "No
// consequential permissions", because "an empty list is a sentence, not a
// blank". A pilot that will write fleet tags and speak in fleet chat must not
// describe itself that way in the Bot Manager, and a class that appeared
// mid-feature would make every already-approved grant read as stale.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY, since an earlier draft of this comment said so
// and was wrong: decision 5's abandonment protocol sends NO chat. It docks,
// leaves the fleet, waits, and accepts a gated invite — see
// `decideAbandonment` in fleetCompanionLoop.ts. If a later phase adds a field
// that actually withholds the chat send, this class stops being unconditional
// and this comment (and the one above the function) must change with it.
//
// ⚠ "combat" IS NOW UNCONDITIONAL TOO, AND THIS SUPERSEDES THE ARGUMENT THAT
// USED TO STAND HERE. Before the 2026-09-11 simplification this was the one
// CONDITIONAL class: no drones, no fitted defensive module, no fitted SELF-
// repair module of any layer, and no fitted remote-repair module of any family
// meant nothing on the ship could be cycled into a fight, so an honestly
// unarmed request could say so. `docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md`,
// "The request, after" ends that possibility: the eight module lists are no
// longer something an operator picks or leaves empty, they are read off the
// hull at start (`requestForFit`, fleetCompanionLoop.ts) — which happens
// AFTER a grant is built and checked, not before. A setup that claimed "no
// combat" and then flew whatever weapons and repairers the hull turned out to
// carry would be a lie `botHost` cannot catch, because it re-derives this same
// policy from the same setup and checks it matches the grant EXACTLY — the
// identical lie on both sides passes that check. `deriveModulesFromFit`
// already earned combat unconditionally for exactly this reason (a fit
// nobody has read yet "may hold anything"); that argument no longer has an
// opt-out left to be an exception to, so it is simply the rule now, for every
// run, with nothing on `CompanionSetup` that could ever turn it off.
//
// "financial" and "inventory" are conditional on `repairsAtStation`, matching
// what the DSL's own `repair-ship` and `dock-and-repair` already claim
// (`runPolicy.ts`: policy(["financial", "inventory"])) — matched rather than
// re-argued, so there is one answer to this question and not two.
//
// No other class ever applies. Nothing on the setup reaches an item, a
// mission, or a colony, so "mission" and "colony" are never in the set, and
// there is no destructive one-shot here for "destructive" to describe.
//
// ─── Restart safety, decided ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Always `restartSafe: true`. Every other loop's rungs (`decideCompanionAction`
// included) re-read authoritative server state on every tick before deciding
// anything — there is no in-memory "I already asked once" the way
// `accept-mission` has (runPolicy.ts:97-99: it may decline an offer, and
// replaying the block after a restart can decline a different one). Starting
// the companion over at the top of its ladder repeats no externally visible
// call; it just asks the same questions again and gets the same answers.

// ─── The codec door for a persisted setup ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The BFF's durable bot roster persists a companion setup as plain JSON and
// re-reads it on every restart (docs/fleet-companion-plan.md, "4. The headless
// launch grant"), exactly the way it re-reads a stored script document. This
// is that setup's ONE gate, mirroring scriptCodec.ts's `decodeScriptValue`
// verdict shape: `{ ok: true, setup }` on success, `{ ok: false, refusal }`
// with one plain sentence otherwise.
//
// Unlike `decodeScriptValue`, there is no warnings channel and no clamp-with-a-
// warning: a `CompanionSetup` is flat, produced by one settings form and never
// hand-edited, so there is no "generous to a hand-edited share" case to serve,
// and every one of its numbers already has a real domain bound
// (fleetCompanionLoop.ts's `MIN_`/`MAX_` constants) rather than an arbitrary
// clamp range invented here. A value outside that bound is not a slightly-off
// number to bring back into range; it is a setup this app's own UI could
// never have produced, so it refuses.
//
// UNKNOWN EXTRA KEYS ARE REFUSED, not ignored — the same choice `readDocument`
// makes for a script document (scriptCodec.ts's `unknownKey`), and for the
// same reason: a stored key this codec does not recognise is a field a later
// version wrote and this version cannot honour, and silently dropping it
// would run a setup that is not the one that was saved. `COMPANION_SETUP_KEYS`
// (imported from fleetCompanionLoop.ts, where the flown shape and the stored
// shape are defined together) is the ONE list of what is recognised, so there
// is no second copy of it in this file to drift out of step — the same lesson
// `COMPANION_GRANT_SCRIPT_REV`'s own comment already records about a bare `1`
// living in two languages.
//
// ⚠ FIFTEEN NAMES ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION TO "REFUSED", AND THEY ARE A FINITE
// MIGRATION, NOT A CRACK IN THE RULE ABOVE. `role`, the eight module-id lists,
// `deriveModulesFromFit`, `useDrones`, `attemptsTagging`, `obeys`,
// `chatCommandSenders` and `safeSpotBookmarkID` were real fields on the
// pre-2026-09-11 request (docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md, "The
// request, after"), and every config an operator has already saved — in
// `hangarPrefs` localStorage, and in the BFF's persisted bot roster — carries
// all fifteen of them. Refusing them outright would make `companionConfigMap`
// (`hangarPrefs.ts`) drop every one of those configs SILENTLY, because it
// treats a failed decode as "nothing was saved here" — so the visible symptom
// of a plain deletion would be every existing squad quietly losing its setup
// on the very next load. `COMPANION_RETIRED_KEYS` below names exactly those
// fifteen: a key on that list is accepted, its value is thrown away without
// being looked at, and it is never written back. A key in NEITHER set is
// still refused — that rule is exactly as strict as it always was. Do not
// read this as "unknown keys are fine now": it is a closed, finite list of
// names this codec once owned and no longer does, and it must stay finite. A
// genuinely new key this codec does not recognise is still a refusal.
//
// The document is flat, so — unlike the script codec's nested tree — a plain
// sequence of early returns is the clearest control flow here; there is no
// recursion depth that would make a throw-caught-at-the-boundary style earn
// its keep.

/**
 * ⚠ A FINITE MIGRATION LIST, NOT A SECOND UNKNOWN-KEY POLICY. See the header

 * survived the 2026-09-11 simplification. The eight module-id lists are now
 * derived from the fit at start; `role` and `deriveModulesFromFit` named a
 * mechanism that no longer has an alternative to select between (a companion
 * always reads its own fit now); `useDrones` and `attemptsTagging` were
 * toggles in front of behaviour that is simply unconditional now; `obeys` and
 * `chatCommandSenders` named channels that are all always on; and
 * `safeSpotBookmarkID` was superseded by warping to the system's own sun
 * (docs/fleet-companion-simplification.md, "The sun exists"). A key on this
 * list is accepted and ignored — decoding one does not resurrect the field,
 * it only stops an old row from being refused for still carrying it.
 *
 * Do NOT add a name here for a field being retired in the future without
 * rereading the paragraph above it: the day this becomes "things we did not
